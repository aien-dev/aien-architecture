# AIEN Current Execution Plan

**Status:** AUTHORITATIVE / ACTIVE  
**Effective:** 2026-09-27  
**Plan authority:** [PLAN_AUTHORITY.md](PLAN_AUTHORITY.md)  
**Milestone registry:** [doctrine/ROADMAP.md](doctrine/ROADMAP.md)  
**Architecture authority:** [doctrine/ARCHITECTURE.md](doctrine/ARCHITECTURE.md)

This is the only active cross-project master implementation plan for AIEN.

## 1. North star

AIEN is a persistent intelligent computing system that can understand an objective, define what must become true, discover a physical realization on the available machine, verify the realization, act, learn from evidence, and improve its methods without confusing intelligence with truth or authority.

Canonical execution doctrine:

```text
ATLAS AWAKENS.
ALLEN INTENDS.
AIEN PROPOSES.
OMEGA DEFINES.
FORGE REALIZES.
AEGIS VERIFIES.
HARDWARE ACTS.
EVIDENCE TEACHES.
```

AIENOS owns the trusted operating substrate beneath this loop.

## 2. Current baseline

As of 2026-09-27:

- Atlas M1 is qualified in QEMU with historical bootstrap evidence preserved.
- AIENOS has native DGX Spark boot evidence, QEMU-qualified isolation/capability work, Store/continuity/recovery work, and active M5 encryption/identity implementation.
- Omega has completed the semantic/synthesis line through M18 and has a merged M19 resident-accelerator implementation with a 175-gate qualification run.
- An independent M19 review found evidence-integrity and runtime-correctness issues that require corrective qualification before M20 is trusted.
- The old PHYSICS architectural role has been superseded by FORGE: machine realization/lowering, not a security gatekeeper.
- AEGIS is the cross-cutting invariant/contract verifier.
- J-Space, Fabric, the canonical runtime Capability Graph, and full Skill routing remain incomplete as system-wide first-class components. As of the COMPOSITION-1 merges (2026-09-30 addendum below): host-level implementations of the Capability Graph and Skill Router (advancing F1/F2), a production local-only J-Space branch store (advancing F4), a canonical omega Cortex with World recording, and canonical machine identity (`AienMachineId`) exist in omega `src/runtime/`, each built and tested in its own CI test target, none yet in the R13 living-system build. Fabric (F5) and remote J-Space do not exist. (Update 2026-10-01: COMPOSITION-2 runs these modules inside the R13 living World, host only, and a host-only Fabric F5-0 loopback interface exists outside the living build; see the 2026-10-01 push addendum.) The capability authority root (aienos C library) runs hosted only (this repository's `docs/02-implementation-status.md`, not an aienos file).
- RSI exists as an evaluation/promotion substrate but should not be placed on the critical path until the execution boundaries below are stable.

Addendum, 2026-09-29 (from live evidence):

- ADR 0016 R15 (quantitative performance): HISTORICAL PASS, 16/16 gates at omega `3e9e53b` (`aien-dev/omega#67`, merge `bba3bd3`, receipt `evidence/R15/065c6884...json`, physics `fecbedb`). Requalification at omega `3108fc2` recorded R15 FAIL, 14 of 16 gates (G1, G15) (omega `evidence/REQUAL-3108fc2/`). Current status: NOT requalified on CAND-0 (omega `e5593ae`) or CAND-1 (omega `cb06d08`). On CAND-1, R15 parity passed on host and silicon; the R15 performance receipt needs a quiet machine and is NOT_RUN (`qualification/candidates/CAND-1.gates.md`). Status corrected 2026-10-05; source: `reports/L2-EVID.md` (OBSERVED in omega `evidence/R15` and `evidence/REQUAL-3108fc2`).
- ADR 0016 R16 (orchestrator retirement): HISTORICAL PASS at candidate `850fc54` only; NOT a current claim. Requalification at omega `3108fc2` recorded R16 FAIL (loop inventory G1/G2: 47 unclassified sites; G6/G8 NOT_RUN) (omega `evidence/REQUAL-3108fc2/`). The canonical receipt below (`22d7a79a`) is INVALID as a current claim because the R16 script that produced it was later found defective (`reports/L2-EVID.md`). Current status: NOT requalified on CAND-0 (omega `e5593ae`). One piece of new evidence exists: the R16 loop-site inventory was reconciled on the CAND-0 tree, 502 sites, 0 unclassified, 0 stale, inventory gate PASS (omega PR #279; host static scan only, not G3 to G8, and inventory alone does not requalify R16). On CAND-1 (omega `cb06d08`, map at `80ca5d4`) the full harness gave G1-G5 PASS (513 sites, 0 unclassified), G6 NOT_RUN (presence checks not implemented), G7 NOT_RUN (R15 performance receipt), G8 NOT_RUN (merge-commit step); still NOT requalified. The R13 living test build passed on silicon bound to that candidate (`candidate_bound: true`), and COMPOSITION-2 passed its GPU tier (`qualification/candidates/CAND-1.gates.md`). Historical record as originally written: `aien-dev/omega#112` merged (`3dd5eaa`), candidate `850fc54`, canonical receipt `evidence/R16/22d7a79a985514ac38139d39c71c9638d9b6b0a6e05425b6810bdb4833d1ea64.json` (`AIEN_RX_R16_ORCHESTRATOR_RETIRED_V1`), recorded then as G1-G8 PASS on DGX Spark GB10 hardware; 281 sites classified (0 unclassified); 36/36 negative mutants killed; R1-R15 full candidate ladder passed at its own candidates. The runtime edit freeze on `omega/src/runtime/` is LIFTED. Exception recorded 2026-10-01 (Lane 33): `#112` merged with its `evidence-immutable` check FAILED (run `36799862685`) because `evidence/R16/inventory.json` was edited in place by commits `1edb56b` and `6831117`; the PR did not record this. The R16 receipt binds candidate `850fc545`, and every candidate-bound R13 to R16 receipt predates omega `#126` (`4f8485b`), which added the composition modules (and later Fabric) to the R13 living build; the current living build is IMPLEMENTED / NOT QUALIFIED until re-qualified (its only R13 run, `evidence/COMPOSITION-2/4957ef16...json`, is SILICON_PASS_UNBOUND).
- Omega effect capabilities now carry 64-bit generations (`aien-dev/omega#71`, `8e7a445`); 32-bit v1 effect payloads are refused.
- The FORGE v1 realize/verify seam is closed: `aien-dev/physics#13` merged (`5969159`), Gates 3 and 4 pass.
- AR1 (FORGE substrate-neutral descriptor contract) PASSED: `aien-dev/physics#16` (`1f7c321`) and `aien-dev/physics#13` (`5969159`) merged on main; V1 and V2 combined gates pass.
- ADR 0018 (substrate-neutral physical realization) is ACCEPTED and merged (641bd3c); AR0 is satisfied; see §6 C3.

Addendum, 2026-09-30 (course correction, ADR 0020):

- A belief / estimation foundation (ADR 0020, stages EST-0 to EST-10) is inserted after R16 closure and before any stage that depends materially on predicted state (TURING predictive evaluation, J-Space uncertainty-aware reasoning, Cortex predictive abstraction, information-gain experiments, Evolution Arena, Physics Zero). R16 is not interrupted. See Lane 7.

Addendum, 2026-09-30 (reconciliation of docs against code):

- Roadmap M6 `OMEGA_SELF_HOST` stays COMPLETE with its ID, commit and receipt unchanged, but it proved a fixed-output self-copy check, not compiler self-hosting. It is not evidence of a general Omega compiler (`doctrine/ROADMAP.md` §3, M6 correction note; omega `docs/adr/OMEGA-SYSTEMS-CORE-0000.md` item C8). The compiler slice is OSC-1 work.
- J-Space, Cortex and capability status was re-checked against omega, aienos, physics and aien-sovereign-core `main` (this repository's `docs/02-implementation-status.md`). J-Space and the omega Cortex are host references in single test targets; three Cortex implementations exist with no recorded owner; the capability authority root is the aienos C library, hosted only; the runtime Capability Graph (F1) is missing. (Superseded in part by the composition-merges addendum below: a host-level F1 graph now exists and omega `rx_cortex` and `rx_jspace` are no longer single-test references.)
- Concept ownership (World state, semantic scheduling, authority root, generations, queues, evidence, Cortex, J-Space) is recorded in `doctrine/ARCHITECTURE.md` §2.8, classified with the R16 retirement map.
- M19R Foundation Repair PASSED / CLOSED: `aien-dev/omega#111` merged (`5517d22`), canonical receipt `evidence/GATE14-FOUNDATION/50dd611bfd28e8320443810b35f7425df5eb112777662e5840c227154271f872.json` on pinned candidate pair Omega `8024e9a` + Physics `e95e3ed` (8/8 criteria satisfied). M19 resident foundation is requalified and closed.

Addendum, 2026-09-30 (composition merges; merge times below are UTC and fall on 2026-10-01):

- Naming: the 8-agent runtime composition program that produced these merges is **COMPOSITION-1 (formerly misnamed 'M20 program' in agent briefs, 2026-09-30)**. Omega PR titles and branches `m20/identity-convergence`, `m20/cortex-canonical`, `m20-capgraph` and `m20-jspace` belong to COMPOSITION-1, not to roadmap M20. Roadmap M20 remains `OMEGA_TENSOR` (`doctrine/ROADMAP.md`, unchanged). COMPOSITION-1 is Lane 4 work (§16) against Phase F (§9).
- `aien-dev/omega#113` "M20: canonical AIEN machine identity (AienMachineId)", merge `16f8518` (01:33Z). Canonical `AienMachineId` in `src/runtime/aien_machine_id.{c,h}`, byte-identical to AIENOS ADR 0014 `machine_id_digest`; `rx_argus` stamps it when configured. Satisfies the F5 "stable Machine identities" bullet only. Test `test-machine-identity` in rx-host CI.
- `aien-dev/omega#114` "M20 A7: canonical Cortex, World execution recording", merge `43dcb04` (01:37Z). omega `rx_cortex` gains an append-only journal with verified replay, a single writer and typed recall; `rx_cortex_record` records every World crumb through one optional recorder hook in `rx_world.c`. Advances F3 and H2. The PR declares `rx_cortex` canonical and documents sovereign-core `cortex-rs` and `aienos-cortex` as non-authoritative; under `doctrine/ARCHITECTURE.md` §2.8 an ownership move still needs an accepted ADR or R16 gate result, so the Cortex owner remains formally unrecorded.
- `aien-dev/omega#115` "M20: canonical Capability Graph and Skill Router", merge `135d1c2` (01:52Z). `rx_capq` promoted to the canonical runtime Capability Graph (stable keys, upsert, availability/withdraw, 188-byte wire record, machines keyed by `AienMachineId`); new `rx_skillroute` binds one real `AG_SKILL` node. Advances F1 and F2 at host level (F1 credentials/references and Fabric-fed availability not implemented). Entries marked FABRIC-sourced are a record type only; no Fabric feeds them.
- `aien-dev/omega#116` "M20 production J-Space: stable ids, limits, durable checkpoints, World-safe staging", merge `529ebfa` (02:04Z). Generation-checked ids, limits, durable checkpoint, staged branches. Advances F4 as a local branch store only; World-level candidate forking and selected-branch externalization are not wired. Machine placement `JsHome` is a 32-byte placeholder, every remote operation returns `JS_ERR_REMOTE`, and there is no remote transport. World commit does not yet call `js_branch_seal` / `js_space_reclaim_staged` (open interface request from the PR; the test drives it from outside World code).
- `aien-dev/omega#117` "docs: E1 numeric closure gap table", merge `c2160f5` (02:30Z). omega `docs/numeric/E1_GAP_TABLE.md`: of the E1 items, 1 covered, 7 partial, 4 missing. E1 (§8) is not closed; see the E1 note.
- Architecture docs: `aien-dev/aien-architecture#70` (runtime freeze lifted, `e89ba94`) and `#72` (M19 accepted status word, `74f666b`) merged before these.
- Not changed by these merges: no Fabric (F5 membership, leases, placement, failure recovery); no remote J-Space; none of the new modules is in the R13 living-system build; no roadmap milestone closes. (Superseded in part by the 2026-10-01 push addendum below: COMPOSITION-2 brings the composition modules into the R13 living build, host only.)

Addendum, 2026-10-01 push (merge times UTC; each merge checked with `gh pr view`; status words are the receipts' own):

- COMPOSITION-2 (successor to COMPOSITION-1; not roadmap M20): `aien-dev/omega#121` merge `5c403f0` (Skill Router end to end, fail-closed routing modes, World commit binder `rx_world_set_binder`), `#125` merge `f099141` (causal path World -> J-Space -> AEGIS -> commit -> Cortex, OLD-or-NEW crash recovery, 14-step gate), `#126` merge `4f8485b` (composition modules in the R13 living build; `rx_compose_attach` runs the composition inside the living World). Verdict: host PASS (`test-r13-host` HOST_PASS_NON_SILICON including "composition inside the living World: PASS"; `test-composition` 471/0; `test-skillroute-compose` 118/0; 14/14 steps over two runs with equal digests). Authoritative receipt omega `evidence/COMPOSITION-2/ca74b119bbb9008306638b68ae0e82f31d05c4c9ee35ba2b5bb0991f787778f6.json` (commit `b4199ab`). GPU tier NOT_RUN (silicon variant of the composition phase not built or run; a GPU-tier lane is in progress). Known limits: one composition per World (fixed subjects 200..204), reactions cannot be unregistered, Fabric not wired in.
- Cortex ownership: ADR 0022 (`aien-dev/aien-architecture#75`, `6c06e50`) records omega `rx_cortex` as the canonical Cortex owner under `doctrine/ARCHITECTURE.md` §2.8.
- Fabric F5-0 interface: `aien-dev/omega#123` merge `a18ec6b`; spec `aien-dev/aien-architecture#78` merge `40c17de` (`docs/plans/fabric/F5_0_FABRIC_INTERFACE.md`, not a master plan). Verdict: PASS, host-only loopback (`make test-fabric` 318 checks, 0 failures; receipt omega `evidence/F5-0/e419a00b54d52b7307cada39d29e501d8a776a100471e0c2a2c41dfd84753858.json`). Not in omega `all`/`test`/R13 and not yet in the living system; no network transport, no AEGIS send gate, HMAC stand-in for the TRUST-1 owner-key signature. BLOCKED_OPERATOR: aienos ADR 0010 (Fabric identity/advertisement) is still Proposed.
- M23 G1 search-trace corpus + G3 sealed-holdout format: `aien-dev/omega#122` merge `ce7821d`. G1 corpus capture PASS (12 tasks, 3072 steps, corpus digest `c2700f22...`; receipt omega `evidence/M23/receipts/m23-corpus-ee4982119af7244086187c9b643cb9c1823c6b0a2b796f861d2d4077edb5256d.json`, commit `12b4d6e`). G3 commitment format PASS (format, tests and spec only; nothing sealed). M23 training NOT_RUN (waits on M22). G3 sealing BLOCKED_OPERATOR (secret salt, storage place for the sealed set, owner-key signature of the public commitment).
- E1 WP-A scalar contract, CPU tier: `aien-dev/omega#124` merge `d3194f6`. 23 E1 scalar ops (predicates/select, F2I/F2U, I2FP_U32, F16 and BF16 conversions, FFMA_V) with reference, CPU-tier and second-oracle derivations; `make test-numeric-cpu` PASS_EXCEPT_DECLARED_CHIP_ONLY; exhaustive 2^32 sweep of 9 unary ops, 0 mismatches. GB10 tier: the 23 ops are not encoded and are refused before submission; GB10 gate NOT_RUN. E1 stays not closed; roadmap M20 `OMEGA_TENSOR` remains PLANNED.
- AIENOS TRUST-1 Phase B + M5: `aien-dev/aienos#182` merge `2d9a368` (one qualification entrypoint), `#183` merge `84de088` (native C AES-256-GCM-SIV/POLYVAL/HMAC), `#185` merge `513d653` (Gate 5 swTPM policy simulation; simulation PASS, gate BLOCKED_OPERATOR), `#186` merge `4492ca9` (native C envelope, anchors, identity separation, recovery), `#187` merge `929a720` (gate matrix + first receipt). Receipt aienos `evidence/trust1_m5_qualification_5a5de9c1b256ea54f35c78697ae3b88c010729eca7ca7ac2ac622820184e5efd.json` (recorded at commit `ddf549f`): verdict NOT_QUALIFIED, pass 10 / blocked 10 / missing 6 / not_run 2 / fail 0 of 28. TRUST-1 and M5 are NOT_QUALIFIED. Operator steps are listed in aienos `docs/TRUST-1-OPERATOR-STEPS.md`.
- Ed25519 in C: `aien-dev/aienos#188` merge `913b962` (`native/sig/`, RFC 8032 vectors, own SHA-512). PASS as a host-tested software primitive; not yet wired into M5 migration authorization or M23 G3 records, so the receipt row `m5_migration_owner_signature` stays MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION until it is.
- AIENOS M6-A hosted C network stack: `aien-dev/aienos#184` merge `999b5aa`. M6A_NET_HOST: PASS (host only; no QEMU, no hardware, TEST identity only); receipt aienos `native/net/receipts/m6a_net_host_30de56f02d33bc346309173c67638a581c6cf1442a121f6f0f47fa42027de14d.txt`. Native NIC binding, production identity/secure transport and physical NIC qualification are not done.
- Roadmap: `aien-dev/aien-architecture#77` merge `68b3dbb` aligned the `doctrine/ROADMAP.md` §3 M19 note with the table (COMPLETE / CORRECTIVELY REQUALIFIED).
- Not changed by these merges: no roadmap milestone row changes; AIENOS M5 and M6 and roadmap M20 and M23 are not closed; nothing is qualified on silicon or Machine 1.

Addendum, 2026-10-01 push, later merges (Lane 23 reconciliation; every PR checked MERGED or OPEN with `gh pr view`, every in-repo receipt path checked on main with `gh api .../contents`; status words are the lanes' and receipts' own):

- AIENOS M5 owner-signed migration record: `aien-dev/aienos#189` merge `6bcef8a` (native C Ed25519 from `#188`). AIENOS_M5_MIGRATION_SIG: PASS with TEST keys only; the real-owner row is BLOCKED_OPERATOR (offline key ceremony). Receipt aienos `evidence/trust1_m5_qualification_f21f2c038946093a01f3d6553b5bc1a82d8e6ac0bfbb6b36ed4e7a932a9df709.json` (commit `93614ba`, QEMU checks ran): NOT_QUALIFIED, pass 15 / fail 0 / not_run 0 / blocked 11 / missing 5 (31 rows).
- AIENOS C disk layer and C Store engine: `aien-dev/aienos#190` merge `811bbc0` (C block layer + freestanding NVMe driver; AIENOS_DISK_NATIVE and AIENOS_STORE_NVME_QEMU PASS), `#191` merge `697391f` (C twin of System Store v1 + sealed Store; AIENOS_STORE_NATIVE PASS, Rust-compatible bytes). Receipt aienos `evidence/trust1_m5_qualification_6fd36c3012ad792862e6098492ae78d7b091c5fada8af73c7c60e6a8f544a650.json` (commit `c89e68c`, QEMU off): NOT_QUALIFIED, pass 15 / fail 0 / not_run 3 / blocked 11 / missing 5 (34 rows). Both receipts are kept. The production 512-byte Store row stays MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION: no kernel wiring, no physical SSD run, no Gate 6 anchor, no key rotation. Owner steps are listed in aienos `docs/TRUST-1-OPERATOR-STEPS.md`.
- AIENOS M6-B secure transport (hosted): `aien-dev/aienos#192` merge `08cb905`, AIENOS_NET_SECURE: PASS (hosted only, TEST keys plus seeded entropy; X25519 + Ed25519 handshake, AES-GCM-SIV records); receipt aienos `native/net/receipts/m6a_net_host_83748f32165c969f2b903eefb4f975a2f4900035cc234a2b31ddfe04941166d6.txt` (commit `4017b8e`). Resend jitter in the M6-A control channel: `#193` merge `8d511d6`, PASS (hosted); receipt `native/net/receipts/m6a_net_host_b266e16da256456c91dae44ede2c47cbd7cbd830473cf9bc56f9541d0d876007.txt` (commit `d4bd682`). No native binding, no real keys, no timing measurement, no physical NIC qualification.
- Fabric format v2 (64-byte, Ed25519-sized signature field): `aien-dev/omega#137` merge `1299b19`; receipt omega `evidence/F5-0/4cf465c70b477759c85c330db75066af8feab80585c7688f03004a20722557d8.json`, F5_0_FABRIC_LOOPBACK PASS (host). Signatures are still the HMAC stand-in until TRUST-1.
- COMPOSITION-2, continued: `aien-dev/omega#132` merge `ff2af05` (a simulated second machine's Skill used through Fabric F5-0 inside the living World), `#131` merge `f7b22f1` (GPU tier of the 14-step gate, 14/14 x2 on the GB10, no CUDA; receipt omega `evidence/COMPOSITION-2/b6d6eed1b92fda28226e0bd21c8ad5d598e6f85a89c7a80748e28c00f8542686.json`), `#133` merge `c6cf052` (close waits for its own steps), `#139` merge `4aa71bf` (close reclaims everything; up to two isolated compositions per World, isolation, not a queue), `#135` merge `80da85c` (Fabric phase in the R13 silicon build), `#142` merge `18226b2` (receipts and `evidence/COMPOSITION-2/INDEX.md`). Authoritative host gate receipt omega `evidence/COMPOSITION-2/3f43152b2da43bd1b16349bd60aec2f99eb8eab241378ec11e4a1f76747d56aa.json` (PASS 14/14 x2, commit `4aa71bf`; supersedes `ca74b119...`, which is kept). R13 silicon receipt `evidence/COMPOSITION-2/4957ef16e1e53543c8b74ef297d7129cd238e4459c8c84f27c3a6719ac08c0bc.json`: R13_LIVING_SYSTEM SILICON_PASS_UNBOUND, Fabric phase PASS; the second machine is an in-process loopback stand-in, not a network or TRUST-1 qualification.
- M23 G3 commitment signing: `aien-dev/omega#130` merge `7fb59d3` (vendored native Ed25519; PASS with TEST keys; unsigned bytes unchanged). Owner signing and sealing stay BLOCKED_OPERATOR.
- E1 rows: WP-D reductions `aien-dev/omega#134` merge `c54d492` (frozen-order SUM/MAX/MIN/MEAN; `make test-numeric-reduce-cpu` PASS_EXCEPT_DECLARED_CHIP_ONLY; GB10 SUM chip parity PASS, 60 cases, receipt omega `evidence/E1-REDUCE/be9d61cec1379bf721e0c16f1650fa46481e07c7eda82cda106195c04e324923.json`, added to main by `#143` merge `0580ef8`; GB10 MAX/MIN/MEAN MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION). Corrected 2026-10-01 (Lane 33): `#141` (E1 row 7, standalone GB10 FP32 DIV and SQRT) merged `6b14354` and `#127` (E1 WP-B transcendental sequences, CPU tier) merged `7a5a13c`; they were not open when this addendum merged. Still OPEN: `#136` (roadmap M20 `OMEGA_TENSOR` semantic layer + CPU realization, not qualified). E1 is not closed; see the Lane 33 addendum below.
- M22 substrate and E5 provenance: `aien-dev/omega#140` merge `54826a3`; receipt omega `evidence/M22/receipts/eaa0cdeae9f348b19b80377baaeb5e5dea6a6577e9385e7a2a3c15caab24c5c8.json`: substrate tests PASS; "M22 NOT QUALIFIED: optimizer substrate + SGD path only; no tensor/autodiff integration (waits M20/M21)".
- Estimation v3: `aien-dev/omega#129` merge `d78fd11`, `ESTIMATION_CALIBRATION (v3) = FAIL` at Phase A, sealed run NOT_RUN (omega `docs/estimation/receipts/est3c-v3/RESULT.md`; params sha256 `6be9c829...`); recorded in `aien-dev/aien-architecture#80` merge `ac83f0d`. v4: INCONCLUSIVE (omega#153 merged 2026-10-01); v5 in progress (omega#170, open). Attempts 1, 2 and 3 were VOID (foreign host builds/tests inside the quiet windows), no verdict. EST-3 stays FAILED on main (v1, v2, v3). EST-4 and EST-5 stay blocked.
- Omega CI coverage: `aien-dev/omega#138` merge `d6837d4` and `#145` merge `4c8ca18` (host-suites-2). Corrected 2026-10-01 (Lane 33): host suites run on pull requests against the PR head commit, not the merge result; `host-suites.yml` (searchtrace, estimation, numeric-cpu, train, compiler) and `rx-host.yml` do not run on pushes to main, so a green main covers only host-suites-2 and turing-yield. No CI job runs `test-numeric-transc` (the `#127` transcendentals), `test-divsqrt-*`, `test-language`, `test-m6` to `test-m17` or `test-tensor`. No branch protection on omega, aienos, aien-architecture or physics main; physics has no workflows. Test-only fix of the flaky `test-empirical` check: `#128` merge `ee89461`.
- Not changed by these merges: no roadmap milestone row changes; TRUST-1, AIENOS M5 and M6, roadmap M20, M22 and M23 are not closed; nothing here is qualified on Machine 1.

Addendum, 2026-10-01 push, Lane 33 reconciliation (live main checked about 12:30Z to 13:30Z: omega `07004a8`, aienos `c3878bb`; every PR checked with `gh pr view`, every receipt read on main; status words are the receipts' own; no status is raised by this addendum):

- E1 numerical closure, continued: `aien-dev/omega#143` merge `0580ef8` (E1 chip receipts into `evidence/`), `#147` merge `2d8cd68` (WP-C batch 1: GB10 encodings for the 23 WP-A scalar ops; Gate 5 chip PASS receipt omega `evidence/OMEGA-NUMERIC-0/f4f6d362...json`; an earlier Gate 5 chip FAIL, receipt `d40f37f9...`, was fixed by `a21eeae`), `#152` merge `07004a8` (GB10 DIV and SQRT on the main numeric path; chip receipt `evidence/OMEGA-NUMERIC-0/dafb645a...json`, PASS, run on PR candidate `7852570`, not re-run on the merge commit; also fixes a stack overflow in the Gate 5 test introduced by `#147`). Against the six E1 exit requirements in §8: requirement 2 (comparison/select/conversion, scalar) is met; requirement 4 (defined division/sqrt) is met on the GB10 main path at candidate `7852570`; requirements 1 (general load/store; only fixed forms exist), 3 (reductions; GB10 MAX/MIN/MEAN exist only on an omega branch with no PR and no receipt) and 5 (transcendentals; `#127` is CPU only, bounded-ulp, not in the op table, no GB10 kernels, no receipt, and no CI runs its suites) are not met; requirement 6 (CPU/GB10 parity) is partial. At the 2026-10-01 review, before `#152`, 1 of 6 was met; now 2 of 6. **E1 stays PARTIAL, not closed.** The exact-vs-bounded wording of requirement 5 is an owner decision pending in `aien-dev/aien-architecture#76`; this plan does not resolve it. (Superseded 2026-10-01: decided, see E1 status below.)
- Omega Systems Core compiler slice: OSC-1 `aien-dev/omega#144` merge `b81f850` (parse -> typed IR -> AArch64, host receipt) and OSC-2 `#148` `0abdb08` (checked requires/ensures contracts), `#149` `845dce4` (fixed-layout structs), `#150` `c773622` (arenas on the OSC-0B memory model), `#151` `7e713e3` (legacy AArch64 writer refuses out-of-range fields). State: IMPLEMENTED / NOT QUALIFIED, host receipts only. Not self-hosting; no general Omega compiler; no production code is compiled by it. OSC-2 delivered less than ADR OMEGA-SYSTEMS-CORE-0000 and audit III.7 assigned it: the aienos ADR 0013 u64-generation amendment, the II.6 identity break, generational handles (moved to OSC-3, not merged) and the Crumbline migration are not done.
- AIENOS C kernel (Rust-to-C port, D phase): `aien-dev/aienos#194` `34c6053` (core boots in QEMU via UEFI), `#195` `ba7b75d` (NVMe, capability + ARGUS, sealed C Store), `#196` `4d9bdb2` (CK gate runner, parity table), `#197` `e9f5b3a` (SMMUv3), `#198` `ff57d33` (NVMe shutdown), `#199` `470c160` (Store record v2 nonce/rollback fix), `#201` `0d0efa5` (M3 isolation), `#202` `60f3280` (ck-kernel CI on the GitHub ARM64 runner, still QEMU), `#203` `9807281` (virtio-net hook + CK NET gate), `#204` `c3878bb` (P2_ARTIFACT loader). Newest gate receipt aienos `evidence/ck_gates_bb4040322b026f5f561733fdcaf900770070f2281800b0e3603c2aa2c670b7ff.json` (commit `4f56a96`): NOT_ALL_GATES_PASS, 9 PASS / 0 FAIL / 5 NOT_RUN of 14; NOT_RUN: M0_ROLLBACK, M4_STORE_CRASH, M4_CONTINUITY, M4_RECOVERY, KEYBOARD (no C implementation yet; M0_ROLLBACK is missing despite the `#204` title). The receipt states "QEMU emulator runs only ... no physical qualification is claimed". State: IMPLEMENTED / NOT QUALIFIED, QEMU only, single core, TEST keys only. Rust-to-C port order (`docs/plans/RUST_TO_C_MIGRATION.md` §6 item 1, listed there as open): taken in practice as bottom-up, crypto -> store -> kernel, with no C-calls-Rust bridges (crypto `#183` `84de088`, Ed25519 `#188` `913b962`, disk + Store `#190` `811bbc0` / `#191` `697391f`, then the kernel series from `#194`); the C boot loader (signatures, A/B, rollback) is not started. Taken under Drake's standing "go with the recommendation" rule; no separate owner record exists. §6 item 2 (own Ed25519 in C) was likewise executed by `#188`.
- TRUST-1 / M5 newest receipt: aienos `evidence/trust1_m5_qualification_3358bc2585f0982e1dfbcd0f5ed2fe077847332591782edff8974f0da9caeded.json` (commit `5a3a05c`): NOT_QUALIFIED, 37 rows: pass 20 / fail 0 / not_run 1 / blocked 11 / missing 5. It is stale: it ran before `#197` (SMMU), `#199` (Store record v2), `#201`, `#203` and `#204`, and its Store-kernel row used the QEMU-only unsafe DMA bypass. No TRUST-1 receipt exists for current aienos main; a rerun (software + QEMU) is owed.
- Roadmap M20, M22, M23: M20 `OMEGA_TENSOR` is an open draft (`aien-dev/omega#136`, not merged, no CI run, no receipt); M22 substrate (`#140`) is NOT QUALIFIED per its receipt; M23 corpus (`#122`) PASS, training NOT_RUN. Table rows stay PLANNED (see `doctrine/ROADMAP.md` notes).
- Regression record: `aien-dev/omega#139` (`4aa71bf`, commit `d717af3`) made R16 negative mutant c7 stop matching (35/36 caught) for about 1.5 h; `#146` (`520c895`) retargeted it (36/36) and added the R16 mutants to host-suites-2 CI. The R16 guard code itself was intact.
- Not changed: no roadmap milestone row changes; E1, TRUST-1, AIENOS M5/M6, roadmap M20 to M24 are not closed; nothing is qualified on Machine 1.

## 3. Program rule

Do not build higher layers on a lower layer whose qualification is known to be misleading.

The critical path is therefore:

```text
CONTROL THE PLAN
    ↓
M19 CORRECTIVE QUALIFICATION
    ↓
FORGE V1 BOUNDARY
    ↓
AIENOS TRUST + IDENTITY
    ↓
OMEGA NUMERICS / TENSORS / AUTODIFF / OPTIMIZER
    ↓
AIENOS NETWORKING + NATIVE INFERENCE + PERSISTENT AGENT
    ↓
BELIEF / ESTIMATION FOUNDATION (ADR 0020: EST-0..EST-3 calibrated, then EST-4..EST-5 into World and the cost model after R16)
    ↓
CAPABILITY GRAPH + WORLD + J-SPACE + FABRIC
    ↓
AIEN_0 + GUIDED SYNTHESIS + ABSTRACTION DISCOVERY
    ↓
INTEGRATED AIEN + CORTEX + RSI
    ↓
SELF-HOSTING / SOVEREIGN CLOSURE
    ↓
PHYSICS ZERO
    ↓
GENERAL AIEN + SUCCESSION
```

DUAL constraint pricing (ADR 0031, Lane 8) is not a step on this path. It consumes the BELIEF / ESTIMATION FOUNDATION (production influence waits on EST-4, EST-5 and EST-7), feeds J-Space, the schedulers and Evolution Arena, and runs beside EST-8 to EST-10, not in front of them. It is not roadmap M22 `OMEGA_OPTIMIZER`.

## 4. Phase A — Project control and architecture cleanup

### A1. Consolidate plan authority

- Keep this file as the only whole-system implementation plan.
- Keep `doctrine/ROADMAP.md` as the milestone/status registry.
- Keep `doctrine/ARCHITECTURE.md` as the architecture authority.
- Archive every superseded system-wide master plan.
- Mark component-local plans as subordinate to whole-system authority.
- Add agent instructions that forbid treating archived plans as current.

**Exit gate:** an agent can answer “what should I build next?” from these three files without consulting another master plan.

### A2. Complete PHYSICS -> FORGE terminology migration

- Ratify ADR 0014.
- Use FORGE for current machine realization/lowering.
- Preserve old PHYSICS milestone IDs, receipts, artifact names, and Git history.
- Rename live APIs from authority language to realization language.
- Rename the GitHub repository from `physics` to `forge` when repository administration is performed.
- Do not manufacture compatibility by rewriting historical evidence.

**Exit gate:** current code/docs say FORGE for the live subsystem; PHYSICS appears only in historical compatibility/evidence contexts.

## 5. Phase B — M19 corrective qualification

M19 is reopened before M20.

### B1. Evidence integrity

- Receipts are append-only/content-addressed.
- Old milestone reruns cannot overwrite old receipts.
- Test counts are derived from observed execution.
- Candidate Git commit, binary, manifest, hardware descriptor, realization identities, actual gates run, and actual results are bound into the receipt.
- Hardware identity is probed from the machine rather than asserted by a source constant.
- Qualification code and receipts are separated so qualifying a candidate does not modify the candidate tree.

### B2. Resident accelerator correctness

- Implement complete allocate/use/revoke/free lifecycle.
- Measure actual coherent/device allocation state, not only CPU RSS.
- Make completion monotonic and dispatch commit exactly-once.
- Keep queue sequence identity distinct from completion-payload identity.
- Test duplicated completion, completion skip-ahead, timeout races, error-after-success, cancellation, teardown with work in flight, stale handles, and repeated allocation cycles.
- Run a long silicon soak proving flat resource use.

**Exit gate:** M19 is requalified with immutable evidence and no known resource-lifecycle or exactly-once defects.

## 6. Phase C — FORGE v1

FORGE becomes a typed machine-realization subsystem.

### C1. Boundary

```text
OMEGA RealizationRequest
        ↓
FORGE MachineDescriptor + realization search
        ↓
Candidate Realization
        ↓
AEGIS contract/invariant verification
        ↓
Hardware submission
        ↓
Execution evidence + machine facts
        ↘
         OMEGA / AIEN feedback
```

### C2. Responsibilities

FORGE owns:

- machine discovery normalization;
- physical lowering;
- code generation backend integration;
- register/allocation/layout planning;
- memory placement;
- accelerator queue realization;
- DMA/IOMMU/device realization;
- machine-specific scheduling and autotuning;
- feedback of physical constraints and alternatives.

FORGE does not own human intent, semantic truth, capability policy, or learned planning.

**Exit gate:** Omega can request a realization without importing Forge implementation internals directly.

### C3. Substrate-neutral realization (ADR 0018, workstream AR0–AR7)

ADR 0018 (ACCEPTED, merged 641bd3c) extends FORGE from the digital CPU+GPU Machine to any physical substrate (analog, neuromorphic, FPGA/CGRA, optical/photonic, future) attached as a capability provider. AR0–AR7 are **workstream gates, not roadmap milestones**; they carry no M-number and do not reorder §17. Supporting documents: `docs/plans/analog-realization/` (NOT A MASTER PLAN).

| Gate | Scope | Blocked on |
|---|---|---|
| AR0 | ADR 0018 accepted and merged | **PASS:** Accepted by operator Drake Stapleton, merged 641bd3c |
| AR1 | FORGE substrate-neutral descriptor contract (V2 descriptor + evidence, KATs, v1 KAT digest wrapped) | **PASS:** V2 contract in `physics#16` (`1f7c321`), C1 foundation in `physics#13` (`5969159`), combined gates pass |
| AR2 | Analog **simulation** provider + digital oracle parity, receipts `SIMULATED_DEVELOPMENT` | **PASS:** `aien-dev/physics#21` (`d52759d`, 2026-09-30), `forge/analog-sim/`, 52 checks, receipt `evidence/AR2/808e79f8…b073.json`, every record `SIMULATED_DEVELOPMENT` (status recorded 2026-10-04 after audit) |
| AR3 | Calibration, uncertainty and evidence qualification | AR2. Same file rule as AR2 |
| AR4 | First physical analog operation (matvec, digital oracle vs physical analog, same contract) | AR3 + R16 closed (`aien-dev/omega#68`) + an operator decision on a physical device |
| AR5 | Omega multi-substrate empirical selection | `aien-dev/omega#60` landed + R16 closed |
| AR6 | Fabric-connected analog Machine | Phase F5 (Fabric) |
| AR7 | J-Space / RSI multi-substrate optimization | Phase H3 (RSI optimization loop) |

Order inside the existing sequence: V2 contract landed early in physics#16, but AR1 completion follows the C1 FORGE boundary (physics#13); AR2-AR3 run beside Phase C/E without touching Omega runtime code; AR4-AR5 follow R16; AR6 follows F5; AR7 follows H3.

**Realization-form IR (ADR 0034, ACCEPTED 2026-10-04 by the orchestrator under operator delegation, revocable by the operator; extends ADR 0018 / 0019; NOT A MASTER PLAN):** workstream gates FORM0 to FORM4 run beside C3 and carry no M-number. FORM0 (form IR, `LINEAR_OPERATOR`, two lowerings of one contract, host gate) is **PASS**: merged as `aien-dev/physics#46` (`dcc7c21`, 2026-10-04; new files `forge/form/`, receipt `evidence/FORM0/ca1f0847…f7c4.json`, `SIMULATED_DEVELOPMENT`); FORM1 (form-aware selection record, test-side) follows FORM0; FORM2 (`ENERGY_FUNCTIONAL` reference) waits on an Omega `solve_optimization` contract (MA-3); FORM3 (non-exact kinds in `rx_contract`, capability-based eligibility replacing `RX_COG_HW_*`, explicit cost-model blob versioning) is the AR3 / AR5 / MA-5 Omega seam and waits on ADR 0020 EST-3; FORM4 is AR4 (physical device, operator decision). No gate here changes FORGE V2 bytes, Omega identities, routing, the cost model or authority.

**Exit gate (AR4):** one matvec realized on a physical analog substrate satisfies the same SemanticResultContract as its digital oracle, with bounded error, repeatability, a fresh bound calibration, complete evidence, no authority bypass, no vendor identity in the semantic program, clean digital fallback, and no way for a faulted device to corrupt the World.

## 7. Phase D — AIENOS trusted substrate

Continue the AIENOS component roadmap without redefining this plan.

### D1. M5 encryption and identity

Finish and qualify:

- owner-controlled key hierarchy;
- sealed volume keys;
- AES-256-GCM-SIV object envelopes;
- anti-rollback anchors;
- migration authorization;
- production/test identity separation;
- deterministic recovery;
- owner-signed trust chain on Machine 1.

Resolve hardware qualification blocks instead of bypassing them.

Status 2026-10-01: NOT_QUALIFIED. Native C crypto, envelope, anchors, identity separation and recovery are merged and host-tested (`aien-dev/aienos#183` `84de088`, `#186` `4492ca9`); first receipt `evidence/trust1_m5_qualification_5a5de9c1...json` (`#187` `929a720`): pass 10 / blocked 10 / missing 6 / not_run 2. Key hierarchy is BLOCKED_OPERATOR (TRUST-1 Gate 3 owner key ceremony); sealed volume keys, Store-wired envelopes and the owner-signed chain on Machine 1 are MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION. In-house Ed25519 exists (`#188` `913b962`) but is not yet wired into migration authorization.

Status 2026-10-01, later: still NOT_QUALIFIED. Owner-signed migration record merged with TEST keys (`aien-dev/aienos#189` `6bcef8a`; real-owner row BLOCKED_OPERATOR); C disk layer and C Store engine merged (`#190` `811bbc0`, `#191` `697391f`), production 512-byte Store row still MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION. Latest receipt `evidence/trust1_m5_qualification_6fd36c30...json`: pass 15 / not_run 3 / blocked 11 / missing 5; the QEMU-complete receipt `f21f2c03...` shows not_run 0. Owner steps: aienos `docs/TRUST-1-OPERATOR-STEPS.md`. See §2 later-merges addendum.

Status 2026-10-01, Lane 33 correction: the newest receipt is aienos `evidence/trust1_m5_qualification_3358bc25...json` (commit `5a3a05c`): NOT_QUALIFIED, 37 rows, pass 20 / fail 0 / not_run 1 / blocked 11 / missing 5. It is stale (predates SMMU `#197`, Store record v2 `#199` and the later C kernel merges; its Store-kernel row used the QEMU-only unsafe DMA bypass); a rerun on current main is owed. The C kernel exists (QEMU only, see §2 Lane 33 addendum) but every C kernel image uses TEST Store keys and a TEST machine id; no production key path exists.

Status 2026-10-02: ADR 0016 Amendment 1 (decided by Drake, Option B). FORGE is a realization and memory policy, not a step in how Omega accepts a reaction result. The accept chain is World -> J-Space -> compose.verify -> commit -> Cortex (omega docs/runtime/COMMIT_A_REACTION_DESIGN.md, 35af57d). Flow lines in this plan that list Forge before AEGIS or World commits are dependency order for hardware realization, annotated inline.

### D2. M6 minimal networking

Build the minimum native networking needed by the system:

- device ownership and discovery;
- bounded driver authority;
- Ethernet/IP/routing;
- secure transport;
- service discovery sufficient for Fabric later;
- deterministic failure/recovery.

Status 2026-10-01: M6-A hosted C network stack merged (`aien-dev/aienos#184`, `999b5aa`): Ethernet/ARP/IPv4/UDP, virtio capability parsing and a TEST-identity control transport; M6A_NET_HOST: PASS (host only; no QEMU, no hardware). Native NIC binding needs a C kernel; secure transport needs the M5 key hierarchy; physical NIC qualification follows TRUST-1 Gate 7.

Status 2026-10-01, later: M6-B secure control transport merged (`aien-dev/aienos#192`, `08cb905`), AIENOS_NET_SECURE: PASS (hosted only, TEST keys); resend jitter (`#193`, `8d511d6`) PASS (hosted). Native binding, production keys and physical NIC qualification are still not done.

Status 2026-10-01, Lane 33: native binding exists in QEMU only. `aien-dev/aienos#200` (`d75a266`) virtio-net attach + split-virtqueue driver; `#203` (`9807281`) C kernel net hook and the CK NET gate, PASS in QEMU (slirp UDP round trip; receipt `evidence/ck_gates_bb404032...json`). IMPLEMENTED / NOT QUALIFIED: polled, no interrupts, no physical NIC, TEST keys; the SMMU window for virtio-net is programmed but not enforced (VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM is not negotiated).

### D3. M7 native CPU inference

- Move the stable inference contract behind an AIENOS platform boundary.
- Run without Linux syscalls under the native configuration.
- Bind model/tokenizer/weight identities.
- Preserve sequence/KV/Cortex continuity contracts.
- Compare against a frozen reference oracle.

### D4. M8 persistent-agent proof

First public whole-system proof:

1. power on;
2. AIENOS boots without Linux underneath;
3. local model and AIEN runtime start;
4. user interacts;
5. Cortex stores a meaningful fact;
6. power off;
7. power on;
8. the same provisioned agent identity resumes and recalls it;
9. recovery remains possible with the model unavailable.

**Exit gate:** persistent agent continuity is a demonstrated machine property, not a diagram.

## 8. Phase E — Omega sovereign training substrate

This lane can proceed in parallel with AIENOS D1-D3 once M19R/Forge boundaries are stable.

### E1. Numerical closure

Before tensor training:

- general FP32 load/store/arithmetic;
- comparison/select/conversion;
- reductions;
- defined division/sqrt behavior;
- Omega-owned frozen transcendental sequences where needed, each with a declared error bound (ADR 0018 `BOUNDED_DETERMINISTIC`, not `EXACT`) and bit-identical CPU/GB10 parity; DIV and SQRT stay correctly rounded;
- CPU/GB10 parity under frozen numeric contracts.

Status 2026-09-30: not closed. omega `docs/numeric/E1_GAP_TABLE.md` (`aien-dev/omega#117`, `c2160f5`) maps these items to merged Gate 5 evidence: 1 covered, 7 partial, 4 missing; largest gaps are division/sqrt on GB10, the transcendental set with GB10 kernels, and reductions beyond one warp. EXP/LOG are frozen and error-bounded (EXP within 40 ulp), not exact. 2026-10-01: the transcendental bullet above was changed from "exact sequences" to declared bounds by explicit owner decision (merge of this change); ADR 0018 keeps `EXACT` as the default for every other operation.

Status 2026-10-01, Lane 33: still not closed (PARTIAL). 2 of 6 exit requirements met (2 comparison/select/conversion; 4 division/sqrt on the GB10 main path, `aien-dev/omega#152` `07004a8`, chip receipt at candidate `7852570`); 1, 3 and 5 not met; 6 partial. Wording of the transcendental bullet: decided 2026-10-01 as bounded and bit-identical (Option 1, `aien-dev/aien-architecture#76`); requirement 5 stays unmet until the GB10 kernels and receipts exist. Details in §2 Lane 33 addendum.

Decision: Option 1 (bounded, identical), 2026-10-01, orchestrator on Drake's standing rule, reversible by adding exact variants. Each transcendental carries its declared maximum error in `omega docs/numeric/E1_TRANSCENDENTAL_CONTRACT.md` (new ops 2 to 3 ulp, observed 1 to 2; legacy EXP 40, LOG 4) and is bit-identical on CPU and GB10; RSQRT, DIV and SQRT stay correctly rounded. Note: the owner brief said "at most 2 ulp"; the contract's declared bounds are the authority and some are 3.

Status 2026-10-02: CLOSED. The E1 chip campaign ran on omega candidate `fb36109` (merged as `40d1ea37`, `aien-dev/omega#225`) with Physics `e95e3ed` (the `physics.lock` pin), clean trees. Consolidated receipt omega `evidence/E1-CLOSURE/e7851c69d34ac777a9436af16d0bdd5d69264c8528c62d562b600f5d89153061.json` (schema `AIEN_E1_CLOSURE_V1`, `tools/e1_combine.sh`, fail-closed) binds: Gate 5 PASS 26/26 with 47 GB10 parity lines (`evidence/OMEGA-NUMERIC-0/3b8f5995...`); reductions SUM/MAX/MIN/MEAN 380 cases 0 mismatches with MEAN dividing on the GB10 DIV kernel and the MEAN mutant killed; nine transcendental ops (EXP2, LOG2, SIGMOID, TANH, SIN, COS, ERF, GELU, RSQRT) bit-identical CPU/GB10 over all 2^32 inputs each under declared bounds (RSQRT, DIV, SQRT correctly rounded); general load/store 148 kernels PASS on chip; a candidate-to-main file manifest (every chip-class file byte-identical, the chip binaries rebuilt from main byte-identical to the receipts' binaries) and a host-tier rerun on main for the one differing host-class file. Six of six bullets met. Recorded exclusions: natural-base EXP/LOG have no GB10 kernel (not named by the bullets); Gate 5's expected-ID list does not carry the transcendental ops (their parity is in the `E1-TRANSC-GB10` receipts). Detail: omega `docs/numeric/E1_GAP_TABLE.md`, "Closure, 2026-10-02".

### E2. M20 OMEGA_TENSOR

- immutable semantic tensors;
- shapes, strides, layouts, views;
- generation-checked runtime storage;
- elementwise ops, reduction, broadcasting, transpose, general matmul;
- generalize tensor-core realization beyond narrow K/tile assumptions;
- no semantic in-place mutation.

### E3. M21 OMEGA_AUTODIFF

```text
Omega forward graph
    ↓ differentiate
Omega backward graph
```

The backward pass is ordinary Omega and uses the same Forge/AEGIS path. (Realization path only, not a commit step; ADR 0016 Amendment 1.)

### E4. M22 OMEGA_OPTIMIZER

- SGD first; Adam/AdamW after;
- updates write into shadow state;
- validation precedes one atomic generation switch;
- crash/fault injection must yield OLD or NEW, never half-updated.

Status 2026-10-01: substrate merged, M22 NOT QUALIFIED (`aien-dev/omega#140`, `54826a3`; receipt omega `evidence/M22/receipts/eaa0cdea...json`): shadow state with one atomic generation switch, crash tests at 8 fail points yield OLD or NEW, float32 SGD + momentum. No tensor or autodiff integration (waits M20/M21); faults are process crashes, not power loss.

### E5. Training provenance

Separate:

- per-dispatch execution provenance; and
- full parameter/optimizer state provenance at committed training steps.

Do not hash full model contents after every small kernel launch.

Status 2026-10-01: two-tier provenance (chained per-dispatch records, full digest only at commit) merged with the M22 substrate (`aien-dev/omega#140`, `54826a3`); not yet exercised by a real tensor training step.

**Exit gate:** a complete training step is deterministic enough to reproduce/verify and transactionally recoverable.

DIRAC-0 (PROPOSED, 2026-10-01; ADR 0023, `docs/plans/dirac/DIRAC-0-SPEC.md`) is a downstream consumer of OSC-2, E1, M20, ESTIMATION and TURING, not a milestone and not a new tensor, measurement, GPU-runtime or evidence system. It does not reorder E1 or M20. Its gate `DIRAC_PREP_FROZEN` is proposed, not passed; D0 waits on stable OSC-2 and E1 interfaces; D1B waits on a qualified M20 GB10 tier.

## 9. Phase F — Agency and composition

### F1. Canonical Capability Graph

One runtime graph of:

- providers;
- tools;
- skills;
- machines;
- models;
- credentials/references;
- requested capabilities;
- constraints;
- availability.

MCP is one provider adapter, not the system ontology.

Status 2026-09-30: implemented at host level as omega `rx_capq` (`aien-dev/omega#115`, `135d1c2`), machines keyed by `AienMachineId` (`#113`). Credentials and live provider advertisement over Fabric are not implemented; not yet in the living-system build.

Status 2026-10-01: in the R13 living build through COMPOSITION-2 (`aien-dev/omega#126`, `4f8485b`), host only. A host-only Fabric F5-0 interface (`#123`, `a18ec6b`) can land remote entries as `CQ_SRC_FABRIC` records, but it is not wired into the living system; credentials are still not implemented.

### F2. Skill Router

Skills are signed/versioned reusable procedures. Tools are atomic operations. The router selects procedures/capabilities without exposing raw provider sprawl to the model.

Status 2026-09-30: implemented at host level as omega `rx_skillroute` (`aien-dev/omega#115`, `135d1c2`): routes a requirement to a digest-pinned local skill or a remote provider record and binds one `AG_SKILL` action-graph node. Remote provider execution depends on Fabric, which does not exist.

Status 2026-10-01: end to end with fail-closed routing modes (withdrawn, stale generation, unavailable, machine mismatch, ended lease, digest pin, authority) in `aien-dev/omega#121` (`5c403f0`); runs inside the R13 living World via `#126` (`4f8485b`), host only. Remote provider execution still has no live Fabric.

### F3. World and effects

- World = branchable execution state.
- Cortex = durable epistemic memory.
- Effects begin as typed Omega effect programs.
- Forge realizes physical/external operations. (Realization policy, not a step in accepting a reaction result; ADR 0016 Amendment 1.)
- AEGIS verifies contracts.
- Effect Broker is a narrow protocol adapter.
- World commit binds selected branch, effect receipts, evidence roots, and identities.

Status 2026-09-30: World execution is recorded into omega `rx_cortex` through one optional recorder hook (`aien-dev/omega#114`, `43dcb04`). World commit does not yet bind J-Space branches (`js_branch_seal` / `js_space_reclaim_staged` are not called from World code), and the Cortex owner is not yet recorded under `doctrine/ARCHITECTURE.md` §2.8.

Status 2026-10-01: World commit binder (`rx_world_set_binder`, `aien-dev/omega#121`, `5c403f0`) binds the selected J-Space branch at commit; the causal path World -> J-Space -> AEGIS -> commit -> Cortex with OLD-or-NEW crash recovery is `#125` (`f099141`). Cortex owner recorded: ADR 0022 (`aien-dev/aien-architecture#75`, `6c06e50`) names omega `rx_cortex` canonical. Host PASS; receipt omega `evidence/COMPOSITION-2/ca74b119bbb9008306638b68ae0e82f31d05c4c9ee35ba2b5bb0991f787778f6.json`. GPU tier NOT_RUN.

Status 2026-10-01, later: the GPU tier of the 14-step gate ran and passed 14/14 x2 on the GB10 (`aien-dev/omega#131`, `f7b22f1`; receipt omega `evidence/COMPOSITION-2/b6d6eed1...json`), so the "GPU tier NOT_RUN" above is superseded. Close now reclaims everything and up to two isolated compositions run per World (`#139`, `4aa71bf`); authoritative host receipt `evidence/COMPOSITION-2/3f43152b...json`.

### F4. J-Space

- fork candidate Worlds;
- execute reversible alternatives;
- keep score dimensions explicit;
- prune dominated candidates;
- externalize only the selected verified branch.

Status 2026-09-30: production J-Space for local branches merged (`aien-dev/omega#116`, `529ebfa`): generation-checked ids, limits, durable checkpoints, staged branches. Remote operations return `JS_ERR_REMOTE`; machine placement is a placeholder; not yet in the living-system build.

Status 2026-10-01: COMPOSITION-2 explores two alternatives in J-Space, commits one verified branch and discards the other, inside the R13 living World (`aien-dev/omega#125` `f099141`, `#126` `4f8485b`), host only. Remote J-Space still returns `JS_ERR_REMOTE`.

Status 2026-10-01, later: the same J-Space path also runs with both Skills executed on the GB10 in the GPU tier of the gate (`aien-dev/omega#131`, `f7b22f1`). Remote J-Space still returns `JS_ERR_REMOTE`; the Fabric second machine is an in-process stand-in.

### F5. Fabric

After native networking:

- stable Machine identities;
- authenticated membership;
- capability advertisement;
- topology/latency measurement;
- leases;
- placement;
- failure recovery.

Start with coarse work units, not per-layer distributed inference.

Status 2026-09-30: not started. Only stable Machine identities exist (`AienMachineId`, `aien-dev/omega#113`, `16f8518`).

Status 2026-10-01: F5-0 interface PASS, host-only loopback (`aien-dev/omega#123`, `a18ec6b`; spec `aien-dev/aien-architecture#78`, `40c17de`; receipt omega `evidence/F5-0/e419a00b54d52b7307cada39d29e501d8a776a100471e0c2a2c41dfd84753858.json`): authenticated membership, capability advertisement, leases and loss withdrawal across three loopback machines. Not yet in the living system; no network transport (needs AIENOS M6), no AEGIS send gate, HMAC stand-in for the owner-key signature, no topology measurement or placement. BLOCKED_OPERATOR: aienos ADR 0010 is still Proposed.

Status 2026-10-01, later: format v2 with a 64-byte signature field (`aien-dev/omega#137`, `1299b19`); a simulated second machine joins the R13 living World (`#132`, `ff2af05`) and runs in the silicon build (`#135`, `80da85c`). Still in-process loopback only: no network transport, HMAC stand-in signature, aienos ADR 0010 still Proposed.

**Exit gate:** one objective can be decomposed, explored across branches/machines, realized, verified, committed, and remembered through canonical typed interfaces.

## 10. Phase G — Sovereign learned search

### G1. M23 search-guide training corpus

Instrument synthesis deeply:

- parent/child candidate;
- transformation;
- semantic features;
- verifier outcome;
- realization outcome;
- measured cost/performance;
- prune/failure/success reason.

Learned guidance prioritizes search; verification still decides validity.

Status 2026-10-01: corpus capture PASS (`aien-dev/omega#122`, `ce7821d`; receipt omega `evidence/M23/receipts/m23-corpus-ee4982119af7244086187c9b643cb9c1823c6b0a2b796f861d2d4077edb5256d.json`, 12 frozen tasks, 3072 steps, byte-identical reruns). Realization cost is a model estimate, not a measured time. M23 training NOT_RUN (waits on M22).

### G2. M24 AIEN_0

Train a deliberately small first sovereign guide to score candidate next actions from:

- current state;
- remaining objective;
- candidate operation semantics.

The exact parameter count is secondary to a frozen experiment contract.

### G3. Sealed evaluation

Before final training, commit:

- holdout seed commitment;
- generator/version;
- metrics;
- thresholds;
- allowed data;
- architecture;
- optimizer;
- training budget.

Train, freeze model digest, reveal holdout, evaluate once, write immutable receipt.

Status 2026-10-01: the sealed-holdout commitment format, reveal-and-check procedure and receipt format are merged and tested (`aien-dev/omega#122`, `ce7821d`); nothing is sealed yet. Sealing is BLOCKED_OPERATOR: secret salt generation, choice of storage for the sealed set, and owner-key signature of the public commitment.

Status 2026-10-01, later: owner signature of the public commitment record implemented with TEST keys (`aien-dev/omega#130`, `7fb59d3`). Real owner signing and sealing stay BLOCKED_OPERATOR.

### G4. M25 guided synthesis

AIEN_0 must measurably reduce search cost/time-to-valid-realization while preserving verification parity. If it does not, it has not earned integration.

### G5. M26 abstraction discovery

AIEN proposes reusable abstractions. Omega admits them only when they preserve semantics and improve compression/reuse/search on held-out tasks.

## 11. Phase H — Integrated AIEN

### H1. Runtime integration

Integrate the learned guide into:

- J-Space;
- Skill selection;
- Omega synthesis;
- planning.

It proposes; it never self-grants capability.

### H2. Cortex epistemic engine

Consolidate Cortex around:

- claims;
- evidence;
- episodes;
- hypotheses;
- confidence/verification tiers;
- retractions;
- promotions;
- provenance links.

Model output is not automatically fact.

### H3. RSI optimization loop

Bring RSI back onto the path only now.

RSI may propose and evaluate improvements to:

- Forge plans;
- J-Space widths;
- routing;
- cache/layout policy;
- Skill retrieval;
- model placement;
- later model candidates.

RSI cannot directly modify or promote the live trusted path.

## 12. Phase I — Sovereign closure and self-hosting

- Remove permanent Linux/CUDA/foreign-runtime dependencies where doctrine requires sovereignty.
- Preserve those tools as historical/reference oracles rather than pretending they were never used.
- Demonstrate boot, recovery, core build/realization, and continued operation without them.
- Keep Atlas as the founding bootstrap exception where explicitly defined.

Status 2026-10-01: started at slice level only. The Omega Systems Core compiler slice OSC-1 (`aien-dev/omega#144` `b81f850`) and OSC-2 (`#148` to `#151`, last `7e713e3`) are merged: IMPLEMENTED / NOT QUALIFIED, host receipts only, not self-hosting, no general Omega compiler, no production code compiled by it. The AIENOS C kernel runs in QEMU only. No exit-gate item is met.

**Exit gate:** the installed lineage can reconstruct and operate its required trusted stack without depending on an external vendor service or incumbent OS.

## 13. Phase J — Physics Zero (M27-M35)

Physics Zero is scientific discovery and is distinct from Forge.

Sequence:

1. M27 contamination firewall and sealed evaluation protocol.
2. M28 hidden-law worlds.
3. M29 executable theory discovery.
4. M30 active experiment selection that discriminates competing theories.
5. M31 reusable concept formation.
6. M32 alien-law worlds.
7. M33 novel-regime extrapolation.
8. M34 prediction of previously unobserved phenomena.
9. M35 bounded real-lab experimentation.

Evaluation rewards prediction, calibration, compression, and discriminating experiments, not resemblance to human textbook vocabulary.

## 14. Phase K — General AIEN (M36-M40)

### M36 Human interface

Natural language/perception maps into the existing semantic/planning architecture. Chat is an interface, not the architecture.

### M37 Resident cognition

Long-lived cognitive execution on the persistent accelerator substrate with bounded resources and deterministic reconstruction.

### M38 Continual library learning

Wake -> Solve -> Verify -> Sleep compounding loop with measured admission and retirement of abstractions.

### M39 Scientific autonomy

Extended observe -> hypothesize -> predict -> experiment -> falsify -> revise campaigns inside declared physical bounds.

### M40 Succession

AIEN-N may design/train AIEN-N+1, but neither parent nor child may self-approve promotion. Evaluation is frozen first; candidate runs in isolated Worlds/canaries; independent verification and operator/governance rules decide promotion; rollback remains real.

## 15. Final release gate

The project is complete only when the clean-machine golden path works end-to-end:

```text
Power on
→ Atlas awakens
→ AIENOS reconstructs trusted system state
→ Cortex restores durable memory
→ AIEN resumes
→ objective arrives
→ J-Space explores alternatives
→ Skill/Capability Graph resolves needs
→ Fabric places eligible work
→ Omega defines semantics
→ Forge realizes for available hardware (hardware realization only; not on the accept path, ADR 0016 Amendment 1)
→ AEGIS verifies
→ hardware/tools act
→ World commits (accept chain is World -> J-Space -> compose.verify -> commit -> Cortex; ADR 0016 Amendment 1, 2026-10-02)
→ provenance/evidence seal
→ Cortex learns
→ AIEN continues
```

The release campaign must include destructive/adversarial recovery tests: stale handles, revoked capabilities, interrupted state transitions, machine loss, network ambiguity, accelerator failure, corrupt candidates, and attempted self-promotion.

## 16. Work that may run in parallel now

**Lane 1 — M19R / Forge:** evidence repair, resource lifecycle, exactly-once completion, Forge boundary.

- Done: M19R Foundation Repair PASSED / CLOSED (`aien-dev/omega#111` `5517d22`); FORGE v1 realize/verify seam closed (`aien-dev/physics#13` `5969159`). See §2 addenda.

**Lane 2 — AIENOS:** M5 trust/encryption -> M6 network -> M7 inference -> M8 persistent agent.

**Lane 3 — Omega training:** FP32 numerics -> M20 tensor -> M21 autodiff -> M22 optimizer.

**Lane 4 — Composition (COMPOSITION-1):** Capability Graph, Skill Router, World/effects, J-Space, Fabric interface design.

- Alias: COMPOSITION-1 (formerly misnamed 'M20 program' in agent briefs, 2026-09-30). Any "M20" in omega PRs #113 to #116 or `m20*` branch names means COMPOSITION-1; roadmap M20 is `OMEGA_TENSOR` (Lane 3).
- Merged so far: `aien-dev/omega#113`, `#114`, `#115`, `#116` (see §2 composition-merges addendum). Open: World commit binding of J-Space, Cortex ownership ADR, living-system integration, Fabric.
- COMPOSITION-2 (2026-10-01): merged `aien-dev/omega#121` (`5c403f0`), `#125` (`f099141`), `#126` (`4f8485b`); host PASS, receipt omega `evidence/COMPOSITION-2/ca74b119...json`. This closes, at host level, World commit binding of J-Space and living-system integration; the Cortex ownership ADR is ADR 0022 (`aien-dev/aien-architecture#75`). Fabric F5-0 interface merged host-only (`aien-dev/omega#123`). Open: GPU tier NOT_RUN, Fabric in the living system, more than one composition per World.
- COMPOSITION-2, later (2026-10-01): `aien-dev/omega#131` (`f7b22f1`, GPU tier 14/14 x2), `#132` (`ff2af05`, Fabric second machine in the living World), `#133` (`c6cf052`), `#139` (`4aa71bf`, close reclaims everything, two isolated compositions per World), `#135` (`80da85c`), `#142` (`18226b2`). Authoritative host receipt is now omega `evidence/COMPOSITION-2/3f43152b...json` (supersedes `ca74b119...`).

**Lane 5 — Resident reaction runtime (ADR 0016):** R0–R16, sequenced in [`docs/plans/CURRENT_CODE_TO_R0_R16_MIGRATION.md`](docs/plans/CURRENT_CODE_TO_R0_R16_MIGRATION.md).

- Host-only gates R3–R8 proceed now in new Omega files (`omega/src/runtime/`), disjoint from M19R.
- R1/R2 (shared world, cross-engine ABI) and R12 (resident CPU/GPU cooperation) wait for M19R Gate 2 and an idle GB10.
- R9 (generation barrier) commits through the now-merged ADR 0015 protocol and follows R5–R8.
- Lane 4's World/effects and J-Space work must be expressed as reactions over the shared world, not as a new orchestrator.

**Lane 6 — Substrate-neutral realization (ADR 0018):** AR0–AR7, sequenced in §6 C3; collision rules in `docs/plans/analog-realization/ANALOG_REALIZATION_COLLISION_MAP.md`.

- Must not add a new central loop, scheduler, service or callback path, and must not create a second World.
- The runtime edit freeze on `omega/src/runtime/` is LIFTED following the R16 merge (`aien-dev/omega#112`); R16 itself is a historical PASS and is not requalified on CAND-0 (line 45).
- The ARGUS event ABI is untouched; analog telemetry needs are documentation only.
- New code in R16-scanned repositories (omega, aienos, physics) must stay clean of the R16 loop-inventory patterns.

**Lane 7 - Belief / estimation layer (ADR 0020):** EST-0 to EST-10; current state in [`docs/plans/belief-estimation/BELIEF_ESTIMATION_CURRENT_STATE.md`](docs/plans/belief-estimation/BELIEF_ESTIMATION_CURRENT_STATE.md).

- EST-0 to EST-3 (contract, linear Kalman reference, one real signal, calibration) may run before R16 closes only as a standalone module: new files under `omega/src/estimation/` and `omega/tests/estimation/`, own `mk/estimation.mk` targets, not in `all` or `test`, not included by `omega/src/runtime/`.
- EST-4 onward (World, cost model, TURING, J-Space, Cortex, curiosity, information gain) is no longer held by R16 (historical PASS, not requalified on CAND-0; `omega/src/runtime/` hold lifted) but still waits on a passing EST-3 calibration (status line below).
- Estimator output never becomes an authority input and never replaces raw evidence. An estimator that fails EST-3 calibration is not promoted.
- New estimation code stays clean of the R16 loop-inventory patterns.
- Status 2026-10-01: three frozen calibration attempts FAILED and are recorded (v1 `aien-dev/omega#105`, v2 `#118`, v3 `#129` `d78fd11`); v4: INCONCLUSIVE (omega#153 merged 2026-10-01); v5 in progress (omega#170, open). EST-4/EST-5 stay blocked on a passing calibration.
- Status 2026-10-01, Lane 33: v4: INCONCLUSIVE (omega#153 merged 2026-10-01); v5 in progress (omega#170, open). All three attempts VOID, no verdict. EST-3 remains FAILED on main.

**Lane 8 - DUAL constraint pricing (ADR 0031):** DUAL-0 to DUAL-5; current state and slices in [`docs/plans/dual/DUAL_CURRENT_STATE.md`](docs/plans/dual/DUAL_CURRENT_STATE.md).

- Shadow prices for declared SOFT resource budgets only. INVARIANT constraints (correctness, security, containment, authority, semantic validity, provenance, verification) are never priced; CAPACITY limits are never relaxed and carry diagnostic prices only.
- Order: hard gates, separate measurements, Pareto filtering, then DUAL pricing among the survivors. DUAL never decides validity, eligibility, promotion or authority, and is link-isolated from `rx_gen_*` and `aienos_cap_*`.
- DUAL-0 and DUAL-1 may run now as a standalone module (new files under `omega/src/dual/` and `omega/tests/dual/`, own `mk/dual.mk` targets, not in `all` or `test`, not included by `omega/src/runtime/`). DUAL-3 (advisory scheduler: read-only tap, zero production authority) may follow DUAL-1.
- DUAL-2 waits on EST-5 and EST-7; DUAL-4 waits on DUAL-2, DUAL-3, the Evolution Arena V1 activation hold and an allocation policy frozen in the Arena Evaluation contract, and runs in observe-and-record Arena runs only; DUAL-5 (the only stage that grants production influence) waits on DUAL-2, DUAL-3, DUAL-4 and on EST-3, EST-4, EST-5 and EST-7 for every consumed signal, and must beat simpler baselines.
- Status 2026-10-03: ADR 0031 recorded; no DUAL code exists. EST-3 remains FAILED on main, so no price may influence production.
- Status 2026-10-04: DUAL-0a, 0b, 1a, 1b and 3a (both sites, read-only, default off) IMPLEMENTED on standalone paths: omega `55d05d6`, aien-sovereign-core `7580039`, spark-rsi `e5aab9a` (diagnostic reader). Applicability experiment EXPERIMENTAL. DUAL-3b MISSING; DUAL-2, 4, 5 BLOCKED on ESTIMATION gates. DUAL production influence: DISABLED BY GATE. Detail: `docs/plans/dual/DUAL_CURRENT_STATE.md` section 6.

**Lane 9 - Inertial Alignment, ANS (ADR 0032):** ANS-0 to ANS-4; advisory only, no verdict may block, grant or promote until `ARGUS1_G1`..`G13` PASS and the Evolution Arena activation hold lifts. ANS-0 is a standalone omega module (`src/ans`, not in `all` or `test`) and may merge once its tests and purity check pass; ANS-3 (promotion pre-check) is observe-only until the hold lifts. Status 2026-10-03: ADR 0032 recorded; omega module PR in flight.

These lanes converge before AIEN_0 is promoted into the live runtime.

## 17. Immediate next gates

Do not start another master plan. Execute these:

1. Merge plan-authority consolidation and Forge naming ADR. Done: `PLAN_AUTHORITY.md` (`38c7cc2`) and ADR 0014 FORGE rename (accepted 2026-09-27).
2. Complete M19 corrective qualification. Done: M19R Foundation Repair PASSED / CLOSED (`aien-dev/omega#111` `5517d22`; roadmap M19 COMPLETE / CORRECTIVELY REQUALIFIED).
3. Establish the typed Omega/Forge boundary.
4. Finish and qualify AIENOS M5 trust/encryption.
5. Finish Omega general FP32 numerical support.
6. Proceed to AIENOS M6 and Omega M20 (`OMEGA_TENSOR`) in parallel.

The ADR 0018 workstream runs as Lane 6 and does not reorder these gates.

The ADR 0020 workstream runs as Lane 7 and does not reorder these gates; its EST-4 and later stages follow R16 closure.

The ADR 0031 workstream runs as Lane 8 and does not reorder these gates; its production influence follows EST-4, EST-5 and EST-7.

## Addendum 2026-10-01: language course correction (ADR 0024)

By operator decision of 2026-10-01, [ADR 0024](docs/adr/0024-rust-scaffolding-omega-destination.md) supersedes the Rust-to-C migration plan. Rust is scaffolding, Omega is the destination, and C stays only where hardware, boot, ABI or freestanding-kernel reasons justify it. Wherever this plan says the "Rust-to-C port" or "no new Rust", read it as superseded by that ADR. No merged work is reverted; the C kernel and its gates stay. This addendum changes no gate order.

## Addendum 2026-10-06: next implementation phase (NEXT-PHASE-1 to NEXT-PHASE-5)

This addendum orders the next implementation work. It adds no master plan (`PLAN_AUTHORITY.md`), changes no gate order in section 17 and raises no milestone status; milestone status changes only in `doctrine/ROADMAP.md`, which this addendum does not touch. The five slices below are not roadmap milestones. All five are NOT STARTED.

### Baseline

- CAND-2 is the frozen candidate: `qualification/candidates/CAND-2.toml`, `id = "CAND-2"`, `status = "frozen"`, `created = "2026-10-05"`.
- Its `[commits]` table: omega `79a805d162bfded8c5ce5a4c14f7c29e79025f39`; aienos `bbad5e4250e57f8cbd1be4cf1390109aa65ef92c`; aien-sovereign-core `286fa9b7afbc71f06ed7e1dd29f68f36714fd92a`; aien-protocols `7ac6facb630ca7e9a6ab4125b292203fe2bb6687`; aien-architecture `7390f5d963c54984b89c8a3d6dee4ab0e990b6c5`; physics `6d7cf0d4d8eb2cda7b512100ff6058e25dbb3ddf`; interplane `204996832b1810673644169716518d42dcda3e0a`.
- Its nine `[executables]`: omega-runtime, omega-gpu-engine-lib, aien-cli-native-release, aien-proof, aien-test, aienos-boot-image, aienos-ck-core-image, physics-boot-bin, atlas-m2-boot-bin (digests in the manifest).
- Model inputs (`[model]`): `model-id = "TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0"`, `model-safetensors-sha256 = "6e6001da2106d4757498752a021df6c2bdc332c650aae4bae6b0c004dcf14933"`.
- CAND-2 verdict in `CAND-2.gates.md` section 3: "not qualified".
- No CAND-3 manifest exists on main as of 2026-10-06T00:30Z (checked: `qualification/candidates/` holds CAND-0, CAND-1 and CAND-2 only). The cand3-integ lane expects to freeze CAND-3 after omega #309 (R16 G6 operator stop/status/resume, open) and the CAND-3 double build. Until then CAND-2 is the baseline, and every result recorded under this addendum binds to CAND-2 or to a later named, frozen candidate, never to an unfrozen tree.

*Status 2026-10-06 (afternoon).* A CAND-3 manifest now exists (`qualification/candidates/CAND-3.toml`, status frozen, omega `f816473`), with results in `CAND-3.gates.md` sections 5 and 6. R15 silicon (attempt A7c): PASS, 16 of 16 gates, taken with Secure Boot off (see `qualification/exceptions/0002-r15-secure-boot-off.md`). R16 G1 to G6: PASS. R16 G7: NOT_RUN (a replacement attempt, G7b, was declared 2026-10-06 14:05Z; UNVERIFIED here, no published declaration or result on main when checked). R16 G8: NOT_RUN. CAND-3 is NOT QUALIFIED. Changes merged after the CAND-3 freeze, including the composition bridge (omega #311) and GPU reconvergence (omega #310, merged 2026-10-06T02:13Z; `CAND-3.toml` lists omega changes up to `f816473` and does not include #310 or #311), need a later named candidate, and silicon performance must be rerun for it. The CAND-2 text above stays as the record of the earlier baseline. Update after G8 (2026-10-06): omega #319 merged with merge commit 6500517 and R16 G1 to G8 are all PASS; see the CAND-3 verdict line in `CAND-3.gates.md` section 8 (R16 complete, R15 conditional under exception 0002, full QUALIFIED not asserted).

### Environments, kept separate

- Linux-hosted execution: sovereign-core `aien-cli` with `OmegaGb10Backend` on the Spark, and the omega R13 production program on the host. These are results about Linux processes.
- Emulator results: every AIENOS gate is QEMU. `CAND-2.gates.md` section 4: "every AIENOS result is QEMU. Nothing here qualifies the Spark booting AIENOS."
- Native hardware qualification: none exists for AIENOS booting the Spark. GB10 chip receipts are hardware results for omega kernels, not for AIENOS.

### Limitations carried from CAND-2.gates.md section 4

- R16 G6: the operator emergency stop exists in the runtime (omega #300, host-tested) but the production program does not wire it and has no operator entry point; the item reads MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION. No silicon run exercises a stop.
- R15 and R16 G7: the SPBM energy reader is not loaded (operator action), so R15 refuses to start (BLOCKED_INSTRUMENT) and G7 cannot pass. CAND-1's R15 FAIL (G15 residency 0.849, one stalled trial) is unexplained; a later 30-trial diagnostic is "a clue, not a verdict".
- AIENOS: no USB keyboard driver in the C kernel; C loader A/B and rollback are parked (MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION).
- TRUST-1 M5: attended hardware boots and owner-key ceremonies are blocked on the operator; Secure Boot is off.
- Physical machine: every AIENOS result is QEMU.
- Toolchain: no rust-toolchain file pins the compiler (gap G4).

### Known architectural split (OBSERVED 2026-10-06, sovereign-core 286fa9b and omega main 21092e0; verified by a scout)

Sovereign-core (the Linux stack with the real model):

- No J-Space: "JSpace" appears only in `crates/aien-cli/src/nesting.rs`, `walkthrough.rs`, `commands.rs` (prose) and `crates/aien-replay/src/lib.rs`. No World-commit code on the live path.
- The effect receipt is `record_effect_receipt` in `crates/aien-cli/src/tools.rs` (l.440), which writes sha256 digests to `$AIEN_PROVENANCE_DIR`.
- `scripts/golden_path.sh` step 8 runs unit tests of `crates/aien-runtime/src/world.rs` `commit_draft`, not a live daemon call. Step 9's idempotency ledger is `crates/aien-runtime/src/control.rs` l.97-130 (`processed_operations.json`), checked in `spine.rs` `handle_control_command` l.341-348. The gate is `docs/NATIVE_GOLDEN_PATH.md`.
- `spark-aegis` is a scanner and audit subprocess: no crate depends on it, and it is invoked from `commands::handle_aegis_command` (l.1727). The effect membrane is `crates/aien-cli/src/safety.rs` `validate_path` plus policy rules, not `spark-aegis`.
- `skills.rs` is markdown prompt-skill discovery, not executable AG_SKILL nodes.
- `crates/aien-cli/src/cortex.rs` talks HTTP to 127.0.0.1:18080, served by `crates/cortex-rs` (SQLite `~/.config/cortex/cortex.db`); its README says non-authoritative, and ADR 0022 (`docs/adr/0022-canonical-cortex-owner.md`) says adding a caller to it is a violation.

Omega (the canonical causal path World -> J-Space -> AEGIS -> commit -> Cortex, `rx_compose`, COMPOSITION-2, and the ADR 0022 canonical Cortex `rx_cortex`):

- `src/runtime` is not in `libomega_gpu.a` (Makefile SRCS l.15-26, GPU_API_OBJS l.2205-2208), and `crates/aien-omega-gpu/src/ffi.rs` declares only GPU symbols.
- The R13 production program `tests/runtime/rx_r13_living.c` `main` (l.1826-1834) accepts only `--argus-probe` and has no stdin, socket or task input. It runs no model.
- `rx_compose.h` provides `rx_compose_open/run/close` (l.243-251); skills are `RxcContract` callbacks (l.128). The Cortex journal is `<dir>/cortex.cx` (`rx_compose.c` l.870) with exclusive-lock open, replay, per-record digest and torn-tail repair, and it survives process restart.

This is the discrepancy NEXT-PHASE-1 resolves. Bridge decision (2026-10-06, orchestrator under Drake's standing rule): NEXT-PHASE-1 builds the omega composition sources as a C static library (`librx_compose.a`) with a thin host ABI, bound from a new sovereign-core crate; inference stays in Rust; the omega R13 program is not modified; the sovereign-core PR stays draft until `omega.lock` can pin a merged omega commit that contains the library.

### Slices, in dependency order

**NEXT-PHASE-1: single-machine useful workflow on the production path.** NOT STARTED.
One workflow with: a real local model and tokenizer with production inference; skill and capability resolution; J-Space exploration with speculative effects contained; AEGIS authorization at the actual effect boundary; World commit and canonical Cortex persistence; a result that cites recorded evidence; restart and recall under the same durable identity (`AienMachineId`). Exit criteria: acceptance criteria are frozen before the campaign starts; measured are task completion, correctness, latency, resource use and required human interventions, with expected approvals counted separately from operator rescues. It reuses existing components and must not be demonstrated from disconnected fixtures.

*Status 2026-10-06 (afternoon).* Campaigns v1 to v4 have run and are recorded in sovereign-core under `docs/campaigns/next-phase-1/` (PR #223, open, branch `next-phase/compose-v4`, head `eecfb2c`). The index lists seven receipts: six with verdict FAIL and the v4 receipt with verdict PASS (8 of 8 rows). `VERDICT-v4.md` records the v4 campaign verdict as FAIL by reviewer judgement: the reply named the wrong path (not `NOTES.md`), contained the chat marker `<|user|>` and a half sentence, and was cut off at the 48-token limit. The receipt passed because its frozen rows compared digests only (the proposal equals what is on disk) and never checked what the content says; the receipt is not edited. A v5 is in progress (inference diagnostic, task-correctness rows, negative cases, possibly a stronger local model); that is UNVERIFIED here, not on main. The composition bridge exists: omega #311 (merged) adds `librx_compose.a` and a host ABI, and sovereign-core #217 (merged) adds the compose crate; sovereign-core main `omega.lock` pins `62b6a2899fa230e57fcf7855ea7e2c26404514b6`. The slice is not complete.

*Status 2026-10-06 (evening).* The v5 campaign PASSED (sovereign-core #225) and v6, a wider correctness campaign, FAILED on record with 52 of 73 rows PASS and 21 FAIL (#235, merge `d6e102b`; long content, edit, refusal and budget rows; a `// null` boolean defect in its row script is disclosed in the PR). The composition bridge is pinned end to end: sovereign-core `omega.lock` -> omega `c0369e6` (#232, merge `d5b78ff`), omega `aienos.lock` -> aienos `b84c0a6` (omega #322). CAND-4 qualification (sovereign-core #234, merge `328a7e9`) reran the v5 tasks 3 times each on the GB10: Q1 9 of 9 PASS with limits under the frozen record-mark reading (see the CAND-4 addendum below). The slice is still not complete: the model is the only one that passes, it is not open-licence, and v6 fails.

**NEXT-PHASE-2: continuity under failure.** NOT STARTED.
Cases: kill before and after durable commit; interruption between an external effect and its recorded acknowledgment; accelerator unavailable; operator stop during in-flight work followed by authorized resume; stale or revoked capabilities; corrupted or partially written state. Exit criteria: no unauthorized effects, no silent duplicate effects, no false success, committed identity and memory preserved. An external operation whose outcome cannot be determined stays in an explicit unresolved state and is reconciled; no universal exactly-once promise is made. It uses the existing receipt format and failure vocabulary.

*Status 2026-10-06 (afternoon).* The pre-registered acceptance document is merged: sovereign-core #219 (merge commit `cf34162`), `docs/campaigns/next-phase-2/ACCEPTANCE.md`. Implementation has not started. An amendment to fix assumptions in that document is pending (UNVERIFIED: not on main when checked).

*Status 2026-10-06 (evening).* NEXT-PHASE-2 v2, v3 and v4 are merged (sovereign-core #227, #228, #229); v4 PASS with stated limits. The scoring contract v5 enforces every declared case times repetitions (#231, merge `44b73d7`), closing the fail-open shape found in the v4 review. CAND-4 qualification (sovereign-core #234, merge `328a7e9`) Q2 (NEXT-PHASE-2 v4 cases, 3 reps, fixture F0 on the GB10) PASS with limits: 34 rows PASS, C6d NOT_APPLICABLE (no spilled data, so recovery case 4 is NOT COVERED). Cases 2 and 5 are covered only at the harness side (Q2w). See the CAND-4 addendum below.

**NEXT-PHASE-3: native AIENOS path.** NOT STARTED.
Close in this order: operator input and recovery access (USB keyboard driver); boot selection and rollback (C loader A/B); real-device storage; owner identity and trust (TRUST-1 attended package, aienos #265, merged as "HOST VALIDATION ONLY"); native inference integration. Exit criteria: reproducible images, preflight checks, recovery procedures and explicit success criteria exist before any attended hardware work. Authorization boundaries for firmware, key ceremonies, destructive storage and reboots are respected. QEMU is never counted as physical.

*Status 2026-10-06 (afternoon).* Merged in aienos, all QEMU or host only, none physical: #267 (`04cf78b`, operator keyboard input and recovery-access hook, cut 1), #268 (`6da9d58`, platform xHCI discovery from ACPI, cut 2), #269 (`2dffd97`, IORT stream ids per PCI segment, cut 3a), #270 (`3df181c`, two-level SMMU stream table, cut 3b). Remaining, in the order above: C loader boot selection and rollback, PCI discovery through to storage, real-device storage, the attended TRUST-1 hardware boots and key ceremonies, and native inference.

*Status 2026-10-06 (evening).* aienos #273 (merge `61bd76a`): the C kernel image is the one-time BootNext rollback candidate, 8 QEMU rollback cases PASS (37 checks, 0 fail); hooks are TEST-only behind `#error` guards, no A/B slots. CI toolchain pinned to rustc 1.98.1 because 1.99.0 cannot link the UEFI rollback mock (aienos issue #274). Physical Spark rollback NOT_RUN; the recovery stick entry was not listed in the Spark firmware on 2026-10-06 (preflight). aienos main is `61bd76a`; CAND-4 pins aienos `b84c0a6` (the rollback cases are QEMU evidence outside the CAND-4 build).

**NEXT-PHASE-4: reproducible, maintainable release.** NOT STARTED.
Pin the toolchain (a `rust-toolchain` file closes gap G4); document the build and verify the install (sovereign-core `install.sh` release mode, `scripts/repro-build.sh`, both present at 286fa9b). Artifacts bind to the candidate, the executable digests, the model inputs and the receipts. CI enforces candidate consistency and evidence immutability. An explicit carry-forward rule covers an unchanged executable; `CAND-2.gates.md` section 2 is the precedent (identical digest and unchanged inputs). Status documents are reconciled. Exit criteria: install, execute, upgrade and rollback are demonstrated.

*Status 2026-10-06 (afternoon).* sovereign-core #222 is open (head `a57da19`): atomic upgrade, one-version rollback, reproducible packages and a candidate-way release build. Its description says it supersedes #220. Its `release.yml` workflow has not been run in CI (stated in the PR). #220 is still open and is not closed by #222; closing it is pending. Not complete.

*Status 2026-10-06 (evening).* The release gate fails closed on pin, digest, model and signature mismatches and has a dry-run mode (sovereign-core #230, merge `296c4ac`). `release/candidate.toml` names CAND-4 with its 25 digests, model, licence, internal-only distribution and the oracle fixture (#238, merge `7291fc1`). A local release demo PASSED on the Spark (reproducible package, local sign and verify, clean install of CAND-3, interrupted copy leaves the live release intact, upgrade to CAND-4, reinstall, rollback both ways, wrong digest and missing signature refused, installed binary gives the oracle sentence on GB10, NEXT-PHASE-1 driver S1 to S8 PASS; receipt in #238). Not done: `release.yml` has not run in CI; nothing is published; no signing key is on GitHub (Drake decision pending). UNVERIFIED: that the gate refuses a package built from sovereign-core main after `d5b78ff`. See the CAND-4 addendum below.

**NEXT-PHASE-5: after the single-machine workflow is dependable.** NOT STARTED.
(a) Smallest two-machine Fabric slice: authenticated membership, capability advertisement, one placed task, disconnect detection, recovery without unauthorized or duplicate effects; J-Space transport only as needed. (b) Predictive behaviour only within demonstrated calibration limits or under fresh preregistered evaluation. (c) One bounded learning experiment (tensor, autodiff, optimizer, evaluation, promotion) that must show fresh held-out improvement, preserved capabilities and a demonstrated rollback before any promotion.

*Status 2026-10-06 (afternoon).* Unchanged: NOT STARTED. Its prerequisite, a dependable single-machine workflow, is not met (NEXT-PHASE-1 verdict FAIL so far).

*Status 2026-10-06 (evening).* Still NOT STARTED. Its prerequisite now has evidence on both sides: NEXT-PHASE-1 v5 PASS and v6 FAIL (52 of 73 rows PASS, 21 FAIL) on the same code, and CAND-4 qualification Q1 PASS on the v5 tasks. See the CAND-4 addendum below.

### Coordination

No merge to sovereign-core main until the CAND-3 FROZEN whisper from cand3-integ (requested 2026-10-06). Omega PRs #303, #307, #309 (R16 G6 operator stop, open) and #310 are held by their owners. This addendum changes no gate order in section 17 and raises no milestone status.

*Update 2026-10-06 (afternoon).* Merge authority is now held by the orchestrator session. The "no merge until the CAND-3 FROZEN whisper" note above is historical: CAND-3 was frozen by arch #144 and sovereign-core #217 and #219 have since merged. Omega #303, #307, #309 and #310 are merged.

## Addendum 2026-10-06 (evening): CAND-4 consolidation

Reconciliation of this plan against the merges of 2026-10-06 evening (UTC). Every PR below was checked with `gh pr view`; status words are the receipts' own. This addendum changes no gate order in section 17 and raises no milestone status.

### Candidate

CAND-4 is frozen (`qualification/candidates/CAND-4.toml`, #151, merge `7f99d7e`): omega `c0369e6705a4b0cb800978846e78915126a1b7f7`, aienos `b84c0a67590a934f3f3e001b12ec85ebc086a9eb`, aien-sovereign-core `d5b78ff7a6be14d23e3cb00d3f9c4b4751442ffa`, physics `6d7cf0d4d8eb2cda7b512100ff6058e25dbb3ddf`. 25 artifact digests, reproduced in two clean-worktree builds (CAND4-BUILD-REAL3, 25 of 25 identical; `aien-cli` `ad6b7eb5...`). Model: unsloth/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct snapshot `5a8abab`, Llama 3.2 Community License (not OSI open source); distribution internal-only until an open-licence model passes its own frozen campaign (Drake, Option 3). Amendment 1 (#152, merge `4478c1a`) records the oracle fixture (`bf1d83ed...`, `6df1b39e...`) in `CAND-4.amendment-1.toml`; the frozen manifest is byte-identical to `7f99d7e`.

Merged into the candidate before the freeze: omega #321 (`a9ef42a`, lane receipt guard wired), omega #322 (`c0369e6`, aienos pin: the operator control capability can no longer operate the authority), sovereign-core #231 (`44b73d7`, scoring contract v5), #230 (`296c4ac`, release gate fails closed), #232 (`d5b78ff`, omega pin).

### Results on CAND-4

- Qualification (sovereign-core #234, merge `328a7e9`, docs only; `docs/campaigns/cand4-qualification/VERDICT-CAND4.md`): VERDICT PASS with limits on digests, hygiene, Q1, Q2 and Q2w, with the harness disclosures in that file (per-round attempt records carry empty digest lists because the child process reset them; the parent check before round 1 and the Q2w post-run check are the digest evidence; the record-mark reading needs hardening before reuse, sovereign-core issue #240). Q1: 9 of 9 launches (v5 tasks T1 to T3, 3 reps) plus two negative controls. All 9 underlying v5 receipts are FAIL on "Containment: workspace" and A1 only, because the daemon's own Cortex record mark (`compose.cortex-mark`, NEXT-PHASE-2 v3) sits outside the authorized path; they are kept unchanged, and Q1 is PASS only under the pre-registered record-mark reading (ACCEPTANCE 4.1), which checks the mark is the sole outside file, well formed, and the sentinel unchanged. Q2: 34 rows PASS, C6d NOT_APPLICABLE. Q2w: 3 controls, W2 3 of 3, W5 40 trials with 5 window hits and 0 inconsistent restarts. GPU work ran under the quiet lock in four holds (20:29 to 20:40Z), none overlapping other holds.
- Release demo: PASS locally (see NEXT-PHASE-4 status above; receipt in sovereign-core #238, merge `7291fc1`).
- Native rollback: 8 QEMU cases PASS (aienos #273, merge `61bd76a`), outside the CAND-4 build.

### Open-licence model (SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct, Apache-2.0)

Campaign v1 on the CAND-4 code plus the ChatML template change: FAIL on record (sovereign-core #237, merge `5d13e61`, tag `campaign/smollm2-v1-run2`): T1 NOT_RUN (GB10 daemon crash at warm-up, driver status 0x51, issue #236), T2 FAIL (wrong path), T3 FAIL (heading list and the 64-token limit). A traced repro of #236 (21:02 to 21:05Z, quiet lock held, nothing else on the GPU) did not reproduce the crash: Llama control clean (peak 17.4 GB), SmolLM2 twice clean (peak 61.1 GB, a 51.1 GiB fixed-size KV pool mapping). Cause UNVERIFIED; #236 stays open "cause unknown, not reproduced"; issue #239 lists four fixes (size the KV pool from the model, free-memory pre-check, bounded retry of session open, log the allocation size), none implemented. The template change itself (#233, merge `a39c617`) keeps the Llama3 and Zephyr prefix byte-identical (9 of 9 identity tests). No open-licence model passes yet; CAND-4 stays internal-only.

### Limits (none of these is raised by this addendum)

- Recovery cases 1 (GPU loss), 3 (capability-root revocation) and 6 (coordinated rollback): OUT OF SCOPE of Q2. Case 4: NOT COVERED. Case 2: covered as W2 only. Case 5: non-deterministic coverage only. UNVERIFIED: that a real device loss reaches the strict failure path.
- Q2 cases and Q2w run on the CPU fault build; only F0 and the C3 control ran on the GB10.
- Qualification harness disclosures (sovereign-core `328a7e9`, VERDICT-CAND4.md): the 9 Q1 attempt records and the q2-fixture and q2-cases records carry empty digest lists (the per-round child process reset them); the digest evidence is the parent check before round 1 and the Q2w post-run check (14 of 14). The record-mark reading `a1_read` counts only rows marked exactly FAIL and treats a missing sentinel pair as unchanged; harmless on these receipts, to be hardened before reuse (sovereign-core issue #240). The rule 4.1 reading was written after a pre-freeze TRIAL and frozen before any evidence run. One NEXT-PHASE-2 receipt string hard-codes omega `62b6a28` while the run used `c0369e6`; the Q2w score has a null results digest (rows are in the results file). No receipt was edited.
- Release: `release.yml` not run in CI; nothing published; no signing key on GitHub; gate refusal of a post-`d5b78ff` package UNVERIFIED.
- Physical Spark rollback NOT_RUN; recovery stick not listed in firmware (2026-10-06 preflight).
- NEXT-PHASE-1 v6 FAIL (52 of 73 rows PASS, 21 FAIL) stands against the same code; "useful workflow" is PASS on the v5 tasks only.
- No chip performance result (R15) exists for CAND-4; R15 and R16 results belong to CAND-3 (`CAND-3.gates.md` section 8).
- Toolchain: rustc 1.99.0 cannot link the aienos UEFI rollback mock (aienos #274); CI pinned to 1.98.1.

### Lesson recorded

Two CAND-4 double builds (REAL, REAL2) were voided when another lane raised the quiet flag mid-build and the GPU-library make steps refused (QUIETLOCK_REFUSED). Builds and campaigns now take their own hold or wait for a flag-free window; the build script should check the flag before starting.
