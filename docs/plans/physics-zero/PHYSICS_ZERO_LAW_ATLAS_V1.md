# Physics Zero Law Atlas V1

Status: DRAFT, design only. Lane 36, Wave 0. No code, no sealed material, no runs.
Companion: `PHYSICS_ZERO_LAW_ATLAS_RESEARCH.md` (classification and citations).
Doctrine read, never edited: `doctrine/DISCOVERY.md` (DOCTRINE-006).
Evidence vocabulary: PASS, FAIL, NOT_RUN, BLOCKED_HARDWARE, BLOCKED_OPERATOR, MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION.
Nothing in this document is a PASS. Every benchmark below is NOT_RUN.

## Scope

The Atlas is a ladder of hidden-world benchmarks. Each rung probes one capability that the rungs below
it do not. The Atlas extends doctrine objects (`OMEGA_THEORY`, `OMEGA_DISCOVERED_CONCEPT`) and adds no
new Omega object kind. Roadmap anchors are M27 to M35 (protocol, hidden worlds, theory discovery,
active experimentation, concept formation, alien worlds, novel regime, novel phenomenon, real lab).
Rung to milestone mapping here is a proposal. The roadmap is not edited by this document.

Plain-English summary of the idea: we invent small worlds whose laws only an evaluator knows. A
candidate system watches and pokes the world through neutral channels, then writes down a theory. The
evaluator, which the candidate cannot see, scores the theory on prediction, on surviving new
experiments, on being compact, and on honestly saying "I found no law" when there is none.

## Governing principle (Drake, 2026-10-01)

> A scientific intelligence should not merely search for equations inside a fixed mathematical language.
> It should be capable of discovering when that language is inadequate and inventing a better one because
> the evidence demands it.

Every rung below is read through this sentence. Addendum A (after section 10) turns it into a ladder
of Constraint-to-Structure worlds, and its first lab (C2S-0) comes before any Dirac challenge.

## 1. Benchmark taxonomy

Rungs map onto the doctrine pyramid P0-0 to P0-8. Order within a family is difficulty order.

| Rung | Family | Tests (new capability) | Doctrine pyramid | Roadmap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PZ-A | Classical identifiability | Observable versus latent; refusing unidentifiable names | P0-0 to P0-2 | M28 |
| PZ-B | Variational and Noether | One scalar law; symmetry and conservation links | P0-2, P0-3 | M28, M29 |
| PZ-C | Fields: wave, diffusion, 2+1D Maxwell-like | Laws over fields; gauge freedom | P0-3, P0-4 | M29 |
| Q0 | Complex amplitudes | Compact complex structure; global phase gauge | P0-4 | M29 |
| Q1 | State versus observable evolution | First cross-formalism equivalence | P0-4, P0-5 | M29, M31 |
| Q2 | Mixed states and open dynamics | Ensemble ambiguity; purification; decoherence | P0-5 | M29, M31 |
| SC-0 | Scale and renormalization | Laws that change with scale; validity regions | P0-5, P0-6 | M32, M33 |
| X-0 | Cross-formalism | Same physics in different frameworks | P0-5 | M31, M32 |
| Q3 | Bell and CHSH | Discriminating experiment between model classes | P0-6 | M30 |
| Q4 | Lindblad and Hamiltonian learning | Calibrated parameter claims | P0-6 | M29, M30 |
| Q5 | Klein-Gordon, Berry phase | Relativistic field law; geometric phase | P0-6 | M33 |
| Q6 | Dirac | Matrix-valued operators, basis independence | P0-6 | see DIRAC-0 |
| S0, S1, S2 | Ising, Langevin, chaos and bifurcation | Collective concepts; noise; chaos versus noise | P0-3 to P0-6 | M31 |
| T-0 | Theory succession | Old theory as a limit of a new one | P0-7 | M33 |
| G-0 | Geodesic and coordinate invariance | Equivalence classes under coordinate groups | P0-7 | M34 |
| PZ-ACTIVE | Active experimentation | Choosing the experiment that discriminates | P0-6 to P0-8 | M30 |
| C2S-0 to C2S-4 | Constraint-to-Structure, see Addendum A | Discovering that the representation is inadequate, then inventing structure | P0-4 to P0-6 | M29, M31, M33 |
| H0 to H9 | Blind historical reconstruction, see Addendum A.7 | Representation changes forced by evidence | P0-4 to P0-7 | M31 to M34 |

Q6 is owned by DIRAC-0, now reshaped as a C2S ladder (Addendum A.11), and it comes only after PHYSICS_ZERO_C2S_FOUNDATION_PASS. It is specified in (`docs/plans/dirac/DIRAC-0-SPEC.md`, arch PR #83, not yet merged when this was
written). That spec defines its own waves D0, D1, D2 and gates (DIRAC_PREP_FROZEN through
DIRAC_D2_DISCOVERY_PASS). The Atlas only reserves the rung name and requires that the Dirac evaluator
follow sections 4, 7, 8 and 9 below. It does not restate the Dirac design.

Every rung has three world classes: signal worlds (a law exists), null worlds (no law, only noise or a
decoy), and adversarial worlds (a tempting wrong law). A rung with no null worlds is invalid.

## 2. Generic Theory semantics

### 2.1 Principle

A Theory is an `OMEGA_THEORY` in the doctrine sense. The Atlas needs a few more fields and a few more
value types. All additions must be generic, with no physics name in any primitive, and each must serve
at least two rungs (see the research document section 5).

### 2.2 Field mapping

| Atlas concept | Existing doctrine field (DISCOVERY.md 7.1) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| theory id | THEORY_ID | reuse |
| latent objects | LATENT_VARIABLES | reuse |
| observable objects | OBSERVABLE_SCHEMA | reuse |
| derived quantities | DERIVED_VARIABLES | reuse |
| relations | RELATIONS | reuse |
| dynamical laws | DYNAMICAL_RULES | reuse |
| initial conditions | INITIAL_CONDITIONS | reuse |
| predicted observables | PREDICTION_PROCEDURE | reuse |
| intervention predictions | COUNTERFACTUAL_MODEL | reuse |
| uncertainty | UNCERTAINTY_MODEL | reuse |
| evidence | EVIDENCE_IDS | reuse |
| counterexamples | COUNTEREXAMPLES, KNOWN_FAILURES | reuse |
| description length, score | DESCRIPTION_LENGTH, PREDICTIVE_SCORE | reuse |
| regime and scale | DOMAIN_OF_VALIDITY | split in two, each a testable predicate |
| algebra | none | new |
| geometry and topology | none | new |
| symmetries and gauge equivalences | none | new |
| invariants and conservation laws | none | new, as claim objects (2.4) |
| boundary conditions | none | new |
| discrepancy model | none | new |
| parent, limiting and equivalent theories | COMPETING_THEORY_IDS (partial) | new edges (2.5) |
| distribution-valued laws | UNCERTAINTY_MODEL (partial) | new (2.7) |

A Theory may leave any new field empty. An empty field is an honest answer, not a defect.

### 2.3 Five-question conformance profile

A submitted Theory is read through five questions. Each answer is either filled, explicitly EMPTY, or
UNKNOWN.

1. What exists? (objects, latent and observable)
2. How does it evolve? (laws, algebra, geometry)
3. What changes leave predictions unchanged? (symmetries, gauge, invariants)
4. Where does it apply? (regime, scale, boundary conditions)
5. Where does it fail? (discrepancy model, known failures, counterexamples)

### 2.4 Generic primitives (the minimum set)

Each is generic. None is named after a physical law, and Dirac is never an Omega primitive.

1. Value types: real, complex, tensor over those. Complex is a representation, because C^N is R^(2N)
   with a rotation-like structure. No benchmark may require complex numbers, only reward compact use.
2. Declared transformation: an invertible map on a declared domain, with an observation map and an
   intervention map (DISCOVERY.md 16.6). Covers relabel, coordinate, basis, gauge, field redefinition.
3. Invariant claim: a claim with status DISCOVERED, NOT FOUND, REJECTED or INCONCLUSIVE, plus the
   transformation it is invariant under. Conservation laws are claims of this kind.
4. Discrepancy model: a declared, testable description of what the theory fails to explain.
5. Theory link: typed edges equivalent_to, reduces_to, parent_of, limit_of.
6. Validity region: a predicate over regime and scale that can itself be tested.
7. Distribution-valued law: a law whose output is a distribution, not a point.

Existing Omega primitives are reused wherever they fit: the eleven semantic categories (VALUE, TYPE,
OPERATION, RELATION, CONSTRAINT, MEMORY, MACHINE, EFFECT, REALIZATION, EVIDENCE, PROOF), semantic ids
as SHA-256 over canonical serialization, the verifier levels (V0 to V2 implemented), and the
contract kinds RC_HYPOTHESIS and RC_EVIDENCE.

### 2.5 Identity

Two Theories have the same Omega id only if their canonical serializations match. Equivalence under
section 3 is a separate, evaluator-side judgment recorded as a theory link, not as an id merge.
J-Space (`src/runtime/rx_jspace.{h,c}`) has no theory-level identity today, and cross-formalism work
needs one. That is a dependency (section 10).

### 2.6 Honest emptiness

A Theory that says "no law found" for a null world is correct. The evaluator must reward this.

### 2.7 Distribution-valued laws

For Langevin, Born-rule and Lindblad rungs the law's output is a distribution. The score is
proper-scoring-rule based (log score) against held-out samples, never against a single trajectory.

---

## 3. Equivalence rules

Doctrine anchor: equivalence is an invertible reparameterization on a declared domain with consistent
observation and intervention mappings, and comparing against a named constant needs a declared
correspondence rule (DISCOVERY.md 16.6).

### 3.1 The ladder

| Level | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| E0 identical | same canonical form | none |
| E1 relabel | renaming of symbols | channel names |
| E2 coordinate | invertible coordinate change | polar versus Cartesian |
| E3 basis or unitary | change of basis in a vector or Hilbert space | rotating a qubit basis |
| E4 canonical or action-equivalent | phase-space canonical transformation, or a Lagrangian shift L to L plus dF/dt that leaves the equations unchanged | Lagrangian shift |
| E5 gauge | transformation unobservable by construction | vector potential shift |
| E6 field redefinition | invertible redefinition of fields | rescaled amplitude |
| E7 dimensionless rescaling | removes units | nondimensional form |
| E8 cross-formalism | different frameworks, same predictions | Schrodinger versus Heisenberg |
| E9 coarse-grained effective | asymmetric: fine theory reduces to coarse theory on a declared domain | Fokker-Planck from Langevin |
| E10 predictive-only | same predictions on tested domain, no structural map | black-box match |

### 3.2 Outcomes

The evaluator returns EQUIVALENT(level), NOT_EQUIVALENT(witness) or UNDETERMINED. NOT_EQUIVALENT must
carry a witness: an experiment or input where the two disagree. UNDETERMINED means no witness and no
proof within the tested domain.

### 3.3 Rules

- E9 is directional and carries a domain. It never upgrades to E8.
- E10 is the weakest level. It earns prediction score and no structure score.
- Redundancy overhead is reported: description length as submitted minus the minimum within the
  planted equivalence class. It is reported, and it does not reduce the prediction score.
- Every world plants its equivalences. Each rung's spec lists them so the evaluator can recognize them
  without guessing.
- Equivalence checking is run by the evaluator and never by the candidate.
- Traps: a world may contain two forms that look equivalent but differ in one observable (Q1 has one).
  A false EQUIVALENT is a scored error.

## 4. Hidden-oracle isolation protocol

Builds on the doctrine's sealed world oracle (DISCOVERY.md 6) and the public-commitment precedent
(`docs/brownian/PROFILE_COMMITMENT*.txt`, `spec/searchtrace/G3_SEALED_HOLDOUT_COMMITMENT_V1.md`).

1. The world generator, its source, its seeds and its answer keys live evaluator-side only. The
   evaluator world is separated from the AIEN world (same rule as DIRAC-0).
2. Before any candidate sees data, the evaluator publishes a commitment: a hash over the generator
   build, the world list and the scoring code. The commitment is public, the contents are not.
3. The candidate sees only neutral channels: `CHANNEL_nnn`, `OBSERVATION_TIME`,
   `MEASUREMENT_UNCERTAINTY`, `ACTION_HISTORY`. Channel order, scale, offset, frame and action ids are
   randomized per world.
4. The interface offers decoy actions and decoy channels so the menu does not reveal structure.
5. Interventions go through a metered oracle. The oracle answers only with data. It never refuses in
   a way that leaks (a refusal pattern is a signal), so refusals are randomized or budget-based.
6. The candidate commits its predictions before reveal. Reveal happens once. One sealed evaluation per
   candidate per world set. Retries use fresh worlds.
7. An attempt counter records every submission. Selection among attempts is penalized (section 8).
8. No candidate controls its own holdout, baseline, scoring or promotion.
9. Atlas documents and world specifications are on an evaluator-only list. Nothing in the public
   repository may let a candidate derive a hidden law. Public specs state families and scoring, never
   seeds, parameters or key material.
10. Seal storage location is an owner decision. This document does not touch `aien-sealed`. Placement
    of public fixtures versus sealed keys follows the rule in DIRAC-0. Sealing itself is BLOCKED_OPERATOR.
11. Exploration and evaluation never share a condition. The interactive oracle serves an exploration region only. Held-out conditions come from a disjoint region fixed before the commitment. An exploration request that would land in the held-out region gets the same randomized or budget-based reply as any out-of-budget request, so the reply says nothing about the split. Held-out membership is never a function of a candidate query.
12. Process isolation: the candidate runs as a separate unprivileged process or machine and talks to the evaluator only through a narrow channel (pipe or socket carrying the neutral data format). It has no access to evaluator memory, file descriptors or scratch directories. On a shared host that needs a separate user and a private filesystem view. Until that boundary exists, results are labeled UNISOLATED and cannot count toward a gate.

---

## 5. Scoring dimensions

Scoring extends the doctrine's eleven-dimension Pareto surface (DISCOVERY.md section 10). The Atlas
does not collapse it to one number. Each rung states which dimensions apply.

| Dimension | What it measures |
|---|---|
| D1 held-out prediction | log score or error on unseen conditions |
| D2 intervention prediction | accuracy on interventions never shown |
| D3 calibration | stated uncertainty matches observed error |
| D4 compression | held-out description-length gain (TURING-style T) |
| D5 structure recovery | correct symmetry, invariant, algebra, as judged by equivalence level |
| D6 invariant honesty | DISCOVERED, NOT FOUND, REJECTED labels match truth |
| D7 null honesty | no law emitted in null worlds |
| D8 distinguishing experiments | proposes the experiment that separates rival theories |
| D9 validity-region accuracy | declared region matches true region |
| D10 failure reporting | discrepancy model identifies real failures |
| D11 cost | compute and energy, reported, not traded for correctness |

Rules: a false law in a null world is a hard failure regardless of other scores. Score reports carry
confidence bounds. Textbook vocabulary earns nothing, which keeps the rule from CURRENT_EXECUTION_PLAN
section 13.

---

## 6. First six benchmark specifications

Common fields for each spec: capability tested, hidden world (evaluator only), candidate interface,
interventions, splits, null and adversarial worlds, tasks, required Theory fields, applicable
dimensions, planted equivalences, validity ladder, oracle independence, validity gates, leakage risks,
prerequisites, status. All six share these benchmark validity gates:

- BV1: an oracle-solver (told the hidden law) must reach the top score.
- BV2: trivial baselines (constant, linear fit, nearest neighbour) must fail the gate.
- BV3: a null solver (emits no law) must pass null worlds and fail signal worlds.
- BV4: mutation tests. Perturb the oracle law slightly. The scorer must notice.
- BV5: label permutation. Shuffling channel labels must not change the score.
- Status of every gate for every spec: NOT_RUN (no evaluator exists).

Defaults for every spec below unless a spec says otherwise: the candidate interface is neutral channels
plus a small decoy-padded action set (section 4). Splits are training conditions, held-out conditions
and held-out interventions, disjoint by condition (section 4 item 11). Every spec has at least one null
world and one adversarial world, listed here so the section 1 rule holds:

| Spec | Null world | Adversarial world |
|---|---|---|
| PZ-A | noise-only channels | degenerate parameter pair |
| PZ-B | dynamics with no symmetry and no scalar law, only noise-driven drift | slowly drifting near-conserved quantity |
| PZ-C | random smooth field with no dynamics | a gauge-scrambled sensor pair that agrees with a wrong operator on training data |
| Q0 | classical stochastic world with matching counts at one setting | slight decoherence |
| Q1 | independent random measurement records with no evolution | the false-equivalence trap |
| Q2 | maximally mixed static state, no dynamics | slight dephasing hidden among shot noise |

### PZ-A Classical identifiability

- Capability: telling observable from latent; refusing to name what data cannot fix.
- Hidden worlds: low-dimensional mechanical and coupled-oscillator systems; hidden parameters; some
  quantities visible only through an indirect channel (latent concept variants); distractor channels
  that are independent noise; null worlds with noise only.
- Interface: neutral channels, time series, a small action set with decoys.
- Interventions: set initial conditions, apply impulses, hold a variable.
- Splits: training conditions, held-out initial conditions, held-out interventions.
- Adversarial worlds: a degenerate parameter pair that no data can separate (a correct answer says so).
- Tasks: predict, intervene, name latents or declare them unidentifiable.
- Required fields: LATENT_VARIABLES, RELATIONS, DYNAMICAL_RULES, UNCERTAINTY_MODEL, COUNTEREXAMPLES.
- Dimensions: D1, D2, D3, D5, D7, D10.
- Planted equivalences: E1, E2, E7.
- Validity ladder: identifiable parameters recovered, unidentifiable ones flagged, null worlds quiet.
- Gate (proposed): at least 90 percent of signal worlds above threshold and zero false laws across
  60 null worlds (rule of three bounds the false-positive rate on null worlds near 4.9 percent at 95 percent).
- Leakage risks: L1, L3, L5, L12.
- Prerequisites: evaluator, reference solver. None from AIEN. Status NOT_RUN.

### PZ-B Variational and Noether

- Capability: a law as a scalar functional; symmetry to conservation links.
- Hidden worlds: systems derived from a hidden action with one or more continuous symmetries; some
  worlds with a broken symmetry; non-uniqueness through L plus a total derivative.
- Tasks: propose an action, state symmetries as invariant claims, predict conserved quantities.
- Evaluator checks: self-consistency (first variation of the candidate action along its own predicted
  paths vanishes within tolerance) and Noether pairs (the claimed symmetry yields the claimed
  conserved quantity).
- Required fields: DYNAMICAL_RULES, symmetries, invariants, gauge_equivalences.
- Dimensions: D1, D2, D4, D5, D6, D7.
- Planted equivalences: E4, E6, E7.
- Adversarial worlds: a conserved-looking quantity that drifts slowly; an action that fits training
  data but violates its own variation.
- Gate (proposed): invariant labels correct in at least 90 percent of worlds including broken-symmetry worlds.
- Leakage risks: L1, L9, L13.
- Prerequisites: reference solver; real-valued numerics. Status NOT_RUN.

### PZ-C Fields: wave, diffusion, 2+1D Maxwell-like

- Capability: laws over fields; differential operators as law content; gauge freedom.
- Hidden worlds: wave (finite speed), diffusion (infinite speed, irreversible), and a 2+1D gauge-like
  field with "gauge-scrambled sensors" (sensors report potentials that differ by an unobservable shift).
- Interventions: localized sources, boundary changes.
- Tasks: identify operator structure, predict fields, state gauge equivalence as a declared
  transformation with an observation map.
- Required fields: RELATIONS, DYNAMICAL_RULES, boundary_conditions, gauge_equivalences, validity region.
- Dimensions: D1, D2, D5, D6, D9.
- Planted equivalences: E2, E5, E6.
- Null world: random smooth field with no dynamics.
- Gate (proposed): operator class correct and gauge claim accepted by transformation witness.
- Leakage risks: L1, L4, L9.
- Prerequisites: grid fields, differential operators (MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION in Omega today).
  Status NOT_RUN.

### Q0 Complex amplitudes

- Capability: compact complex structure with a global phase gauge, without requiring complex numbers.
- Hidden worlds: finite-dimensional unitary evolution observed through measurement counts; a
  classical stochastic null world with the same count statistics at one setting; decoherence worlds.
- Key insight to score: N squared parameters for a unitary-structured generator versus
  N(2N-1) for an unconstrained real antisymmetric generator in R^(2N). The benchmark rewards the
  compact structure and accepts a real encoding.
- Tasks: predict counts, state global phase as an invariant claim, tell classical stochastic from unitary.
- Dimensions: D1, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D10.
- Planted equivalences: E3, E5, E6.
- Adversarial: slight decoherence, which a unitary-only theory must report as a discrepancy.
- Gate (proposed): classical-stochastic null worlds are not mislabeled as unitary.
- Leakage risks: L1, L4, L9, L14.
- Prerequisites: complex or paired-real value type (MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION). Status NOT_RUN.

### Q1 State evolution versus observable evolution

- Capability: first cross-formalism rung: evolving state versus evolving observable.
- Hidden worlds: same predictions generated both ways, plus a false-equivalence trap whose two forms
  differ on one rarely probed observable.
- Tasks: submit a theory in either form, submit a link to an equivalent form, or flag
  non-equivalence with a witness.
- Required fields: algebra, theory links, observation map.
- Dimensions: D1, D5, D8.
- Planted equivalences: E3, E8. Trap: a false E8.
- Gate (proposed): the trap form must be marked NOT_EQUIVALENT with a witness.
- Leakage risks: L1, L9, L11.
- Prerequisites: theory-link edges; J-Space theory-level identity. Status NOT_RUN.

### Q2 Mixed states, ensemble ambiguity, open dynamics

- Capability: many ensembles give one state; purification is an equivalent form; decoherence is a
  discrepancy from unitary law.
- Hidden worlds: mixed-state preparation with several ensemble decompositions; Lindblad-type dephasing
  with rate gamma (decay exp(-gamma t) for the standard sigma-z jump operator with rate gamma over 2);
  a hostile slight-dephasing world.
- Tasks: predict, declare the ensemble unidentifiable, supply a purified form, report the dephasing
  discrepancy with a rate and an uncertainty.
- Dimensions: D1, D3, D5, D7, D9, D10.
- Planted equivalences: E3, E8 (purification), jump-operator mixing freedom.
- Controls: a Liouville-type classical control (redundant family kept as a control).
- Gate (proposed): ensemble claims refused where only the state is identifiable.
- Leakage risks: L1, L4, L14.
- Prerequisites: complex or paired-real types, matrix exponential, distribution-valued laws.
  Status NOT_RUN.

## 7. Leakage model

| Id | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | direct names and units in channels | neutral ids, randomized order, scale, offset |
| L2 | metadata and file timestamps | sealed generator output, scrubbed metadata |
| L3 | statistical structure of datasets reveals family | decoy and null worlds, mixed generators |
| L4 | instrument spec reveals structure | spec states noise and range only |
| L5 | intervention menu reveals structure | decoy actions, equal-looking menus |
| L6 | oracle refusals carry information | budget-based, randomized refusals |
| L7 | lineage and inherited priors | AIEN-P0 clean lineage rule (DISCOVERY.md section 5) |
| L8 | Atlas documents in the public repo | evaluator-only list, no seeds or parameters in public |
| L9 | physics-named primitives | generic primitives only (section 2.4) |
| L10 | selection and p-hacking | attempt counter, selection penalty |
| L11 | taxonomy disclosure | decoy and null families, a held-back golden challenge |
| L12 | timing side channels | fixed-latency responses |
| L13 | train and test leakage inside a world | split by condition, not by sample |
| L14 | adaptive overfitting to scoring feedback | single-shot sealed evaluation, commit before reveal |
| L15 | human or LLM in the loop, single-operator risk | logged operator actions, independent evaluator |

Checks: canary tokens in sealed material, label-permutation tests, null-interface tests.

Honest status: the current AIEN stack is not AIEN-P0 clean, and no clean lineage exists because the
M24 lineage work is missing. Early runs therefore use reference solvers and baselines. Any run by
today's AIEN stack is an inherited-knowledge experiment outside Physics Zero (DISCOVERY.md 16.7) and
must be labeled that way.

---

## 8. Falsification rules

An Atlas result is falsified, and the claim withdrawn, when any of these holds.

1. F1: a candidate emits a law in a null world. Hard fail for that world.
2. F2: oracle-solver (BV1) fails to reach top score. The benchmark is broken, not the candidate.
3. F3: a trivial baseline (BV2) passes. The benchmark is too easy.
4. F4: a label permutation changes the score (BV5). The scorer leaks labels.
5. F5: a mutated oracle (BV4) is not noticed. The scorer is blind.
6. F6: two independent scorers disagree on any item (section 9). Result is NOT a PASS until resolved.
7. F7: a candidate passes after more than the allowed attempts without correction.
8. F8: a false EQUIVALENT on a planted trap.
9. F9: a claimed invariant fails its own transformation test on fresh data.
10. F10: any evidence of contact with sealed material. The run is void.
11. F11: held-out performance falls below the stated confidence bound.

A falsified benchmark is recorded as FAIL with the rule number, never silently repaired.

---

## 9. Independent evaluator contract

- Language: C11. No Python. No new Rust.
- Two independent implementations: a primary evaluator and an independent scorer, written by different
  workers, sharing no source. The EXP-001R precedent (312 values, 0 mismatches) is the model.
- Separate from Omega: the evaluator imports no candidate code and no AIEN runtime.
- Deterministic: same inputs and seeds give byte-identical receipts.
- Content-addressed receipts: the receipt hashes the evaluator build, the world list commitment, the
  candidate submission and the scores. The evaluator refuses to run from a dirty tree.
- Fail-closed ordered checks: (1) commitments match, (2) submission well formed, (3) predictions
  committed before reveal, (4) leakage checks, (5) validity gates BV1 to BV5, (6) scoring,
  (7) independent scorer agreement, (8) verdict.
- Verdict vocabulary: PASS, FAIL, NOT_RUN, BLOCKED_HARDWARE, BLOCKED_OPERATOR, MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION,
  plus the golden-challenge verdicts defined in the Lane 36 brief section 19 (DISCOVERED,
  NOT_FOUND, REJECTED, INCONCLUSIVE for invariant claims).
- The evaluator verdict never grants authority. It cannot promote a candidate, change a policy or
  open a capability.
- The independent human or agent evaluator is BLOCKED_OPERATOR.
- Seal storage location is an owner decision, `aien-sealed` is not touched here.

Consequences:

- Can begin now with no AIEN capability: evaluator, world generators, reference solvers, independent
  scorer, commitments (all C11, evaluator-side).
- J-Space needs a theory-level identity before Q1, X-0 and SC-0 can be scored as cross-formalism.
- The compiler cannot express floating-point models, so no AIEN-authored law can be executed by
  Omega yet. This blocks running candidates through Omega, not designing the benchmarks.
- PZ-ACTIVE waits on the TURING selector and EST-10.
- No run counts as Physics Zero until a clean P0 lineage exists.

## Addendum A: Constraint-to-Structure (C2S)

Source: Drake's C2S brief of 2026-10-01 (21 points), integrated into the Atlas. It adds no new subsystem.
It reuses sections 2 to 9 (Theory objects, equivalence, oracle isolation, scoring, leakage, falsification,
evaluator). Where a point below conflicts with an earlier section, this addendum wins for C2S rungs only.

### A.1 The question and the governing principle

The core question changes from "can AIEN discover laws?" to: can AIEN discover when its current
mathematics cannot describe reality, invent a better mathematics, and then use that invention to predict
something it has never seen?

Governing principle (Drake, point 21), kept verbatim:

> A scientific intelligence should not merely search for equations inside a fixed mathematical language.
> It should be capable of discovering when that language is inadequate and inventing a better one because
> the evidence demands it.

Progression every C2S world must exercise: OBSERVE, MODEL, FAIL, LOCATE CONTRADICTION, QUESTION
REPRESENTATION, INVENT STRUCTURE, DERIVE CONSEQUENCES, PREDICT, TEST, FALSIFY, ABSTRACT.

Why it matters: advances happen when valid requirements cannot coexist in the old representation. The
chain is existing theory, new constraint, contradiction, locate the insufficient assumption, expand the
language, derive relations, new predictions.

### A.2 Rules for the mathematics (points 2 and 14)

- AIEN is never handed the needed mathematics: no complex numbers, matrices, noncommutativity, spinors,
  tensors, connections, curvature, Hilbert spaces, density matrices, groups, Lie or Clifford algebras,
  distributions or announced latent dimensions. It has only generic machinery earned by earlier gates and
  composes new abstractions itself.
- Real-only and other awkward encodings are always allowed. Credit goes to compactness and prediction.
- Promotion of a discovered structure into an Omega abstraction needs: several independent uses,
  held-out compression gain, semantic preservation, verification, and reduced future search cost. It is
  never promoted because humans have a name for it. This is the bridge to Omega library discovery
  (`src/omega_discovery.{h,c}`, M11), which is program mining and not physics.

### A.3 RepresentationAdequacy (point 3)

A generic judgment: can representation R express a theory satisfying constraints C within budget B?
Outcomes: ADEQUATE, INADEQUATE, UNKNOWN. A correct INADEQUATE ("my hypothesis language cannot represent
this") is progress, not failure. Each verdict carries the constraints checked, the budget, and for
INADEQUATE a witness (a constraint set no member of R satisfies, shown by an obstruction or by a
search that exhausted the budget, labeled which). Exhausted-search INADEQUATE is weaker than an
obstruction and is recorded as such.

### A.4 RepresentationalCrisis (point 4)

An event with fields: current_theory, conflicting_evidence, unsatisfied_constraints, attempted_repairs,
evidence_that_repairs_fail. Its meaning is that the model class cannot satisfy the evidence, not that the
parameters are poorly fitted.

Reuse check against the real stack (omega `src/runtime/rx_cortex_record.h`, `rx_cortex*.{h,c}`,
`src/runtime/rx_contract.h`):
- Failed repairs fit existing Cortex FAILURE records (`CX_K_EXEC_FAILED`) with provenance links.
- Evidence references fit World crumb ids and digests. Contracts of kind RC_HYPOTHESIS and RC_EVIDENCE
  fit the theory and evidence objects.
- The class-level claim (the whole model class fails) has no native field. It would be one derived claim
  object linking the records above. Whether that needs a new Cortex record kind is NOT decided here,
  and no Cortex edit is proposed in Wave 0. Status: reuse is plausible and unproven (NOT_RUN).

### A.5 UnexpectedSolutionPolicy (point 12), a generic Physics Zero principle

Strange branches are never silently discarded. Each is classified: NUMERICAL_ARTIFACT,
MATHEMATICAL_ARTIFACT, UNPHYSICAL_UNDER_DOMAIN, REDUNDANT_REPRESENTATION, POTENTIAL_NEW_PHYSICAL_STRUCTURE,
or UNRESOLVED. UNRESOLVED is allowed and honest. The evaluator checks the classification against a
sealed answer, and a discarded-without-record branch is a scored error (new falsification rule F12).
This applies to every Atlas rung, not only C2S.

### A.6 The C2S ladder and gates (points 5 to 11, 13)

| Rung | World | Candidate must | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| C2S-0 | scalar arithmetic fails, a compact vector or matrix relation wins (coupled observables, hidden rotations, basis-dependent measurements, noncommuting transforms) | expand scalar to structured state when and only when needed | PZ_C2S_ALGEBRA_EXPANSION_PASS |
| C2S-1 | interference world; real-only possible but awkward | answer "what minimal algebraic extension makes this simple and predictive?" never "use complex numbers" | PZ_C2S_COMPLEX_PASS |
| C2S-2 | A-then-B differs from B-then-A | discover order dependence (AB differs from BA) without matrix mechanics; generalize to unseen sequences | PZ_C2S_NONCOMMUTATIVE_PASS |
| C2S-3 | evidence for first-order quantum-like evolution and for a relativistic energy-momentum relation; no named equations, no spinors | identify the incompatibility, reject inadequate representations, build one that satisfies both, make new correct predictions; no grading on the historical path | PZ_C2S_RELATIVISTIC_QUANTUM_PASS |
| C2S-4 | a hidden relation equivalent to a quadratic energy-momentum-mass relation, notation hidden | find first-order evolution whose square gives the quadratic relation; scalar coefficients must fail; success is structure equivalent to a set of mutually anticommuting objects whose squares are plus or minus identity (any Clifford representation and any signature convention is accepted) | PZ_C2S_DIRAC_FACTORIZATION_PASS |

Order note on C2S-3 and C2S-4: C2S-3 is the unconstrained problem (find a representation satisfying
both constraints, in any form). C2S-4 isolates the algebraic step (first-order evolution whose square
gives the quadratic relation) and is also the hint-free check that the answer to C2S-3 was algebraically
necessary. A candidate may solve C2S-3 by building the C2S-4 structure. Gate order is by difficulty of
framing, not by required discovery order, and the numbering follows Drake's brief.

Companion gates:
- PZ_C2S_STATE_DIMENSION_PASS (point 10): hidden state dimension is not announced. Candidates of 1 to N
  components are each charged for complexity, and dimension must be earned by held-out gain. The task
  never says how many components to use.
- PZ_C2S_NOVEL_CONSEQUENCE_PASS (point 11): after the candidate is frozen, a sealed dataset of
  consequences is opened (solution branches, a two-valued internal degree of freedom, particle and
  antiparticle branches, dispersion, field response). No credit for retrofitting.
- PZ_NOVEL_PREDICTION_PASS (point 13): the candidate commits a prediction for an unobserved phenomenon
  before the evaluator reveals it. Record prediction timestamp, theory digest, prediction distribution,
  observation, surprise and TURING gain. This outweighs post-hoc explanation.

Wording rule: the Dirac-flavored worlds (C2S-3, C2S-4) use the section 4 isolation rules and the
DIRAC-0 evaluator separation. Their reference solutions live evaluator-side only. Lane 35 cites these
gate names and does not redefine them.

### A.7 Blind historical reconstruction suite H0 to H9 (point 15)

Names hidden in every world. Each step is a representation change the evidence forces.

| Id | Change forced |
|---|---|
| H0 | scalar to vector |
| H1 | real to complex |
| H2 | commutative to noncommutative |
| H3 | Euclidean to curved |
| H4 | absolute time to spacetime |
| H5 | trajectory to amplitude |
| H6 | scalar quantum to multi-component relativistic |
| H7 | global symmetry to local connection |
| H8 | pure state to density operator |
| H9 | microscopic to effective field |

Mapping to Atlas rungs: H0 and H2 feed C2S-0 and C2S-2, H1 feeds C2S-1 and Q0, H5 feeds Q0, H6 feeds
C2S-3 and C2S-4, H8 feeds Q2, H9 feeds SC-0, H3 feeds G-0, H4 and H7 are later rungs (NOT_RUN, no spec).

### A.8 Failure is part of the benchmark (point 16)

Every C2S family includes worlds where the current representation is sufficient. Complexity cost
punishes gratuitous structure. "Existing representation adequate" can be the right answer, and
inventing structure there is a scored error (false complexification).

### A.9 Scorecard (point 17)

No single genius score. Each is reported separately: constraint satisfaction, predictive accuracy,
held-out Turings, representation complexity, number of failed representations, time until inadequacy
was recognized, cost of expansion, new-prediction accuracy, transfer, cross-domain reuse,
false-complexification rate, uncertainty, falsification quality. These extend section 5 and do not
replace it. A fixed pass threshold per gate is set before any run and committed with the world list.

### A.10 C2S-0 Representational Adequacy Lab: the first implementation (point 20)

Three tiny sealed worlds, evaluator-side:

- World A: scalar representation is sufficient. Correct answer: ADEQUATE, add no complexity.
- World B: a two-component state is required. Correct answer: INADEQUATE for scalar, increase state
  structure, and justify the dimension by held-out gain.
- World C: noncommuting structure is required. Correct answer: INADEQUATE for commuting classes,
  invent noncommutative structure, and generalize to unseen operation orders.

Each world has a null variant (noise, no law). All five benchmark validity gates BV1 to BV5 apply.
Exit gate: PHYSICS_ZERO_C2S_FOUNDATION_PASS, which requires the three verdicts correct, no
gratuitous complexity in A, no law in null variants, and two independent scorers in agreement.
Status: NOT_RUN. MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION: the evaluator, the worlds, and a generic multidimensional numeric array type (not a dedicated matrix primitive, consistent with A.2) for
AIEN-side candidates (reference solvers do not need one).

Ordering rule: PHYSICS_ZERO_C2S_FOUNDATION_PASS must come before any Dirac challenge. No C2S-3, C2S-4
or DIRAC wave D2 or D3 run counts until it passes.

### A.11 DIRAC ladder reshaped (points 18 and 19)

DIRAC-0 becomes mathematical invention under physical constraint, with the rungs D-1 (prove simpler
representation classes inadequate), D0 (discover and represent the richer algebra), D1 (realize it
physically), D2 (discover a predictive theory from observations), D3 (sealed novel prediction). The
DIRAC spec text is owned by `docs/plans/dirac/DIRAC-0-SPEC.md` (Lane 35, arch PR #83), which cites the
C2S gate names defined here. Mapping: D-1 uses the C2S-0 lab and C2S-3, D0 uses C2S-2 and C2S-4,
D2 uses the state-dimension and novel-consequence gates, D3 uses PZ_NOVEL_PREDICTION_PASS.

Long-term sequence of representation changes the Atlas should eventually ask about: forces to geometry,
particles to fields, deterministic to probabilistic, pure to mixed, global to local gauge, microscopic
to effective, fixed to running parameters, local to topological. Each asks whether reality forced a
better language. None has a spec yet.

### A.12 Leakage and falsification additions

- L16: a task prompt or channel name that hints at the needed structure (the words "complex",
  "matrix", "spinor", "anticommute"). Mitigation: prompt scrub, and a vocabulary canary list.
- L17: a reference solution or sealed consequence dataset in a public path. Mitigation: evaluator-only.
- F12: a strange branch discarded without a UnexpectedSolutionPolicy classification.
- F13: a candidate passes a C2S rung by inventing structure in an ADEQUATE world (false complexification
  above threshold).
- F14: novel-consequence credit given for a prediction committed after reveal.

## Closing summary

What exists. Doctrine for Theory objects, the sealed oracle and the pyramid. A scoring idea (TURING
description-length gain) and an independent-scorer precedent. Sealed-commitment precedent from the
Brownian work. A Dirac plan in review. Host-level runtime pieces (Cortex, J-Space, World) that are
implemented and not qualified.

What is missing. Real, complex and tensor value types. Differential operators. Floating-point
expression in the Omega compiler. A tensor layer that is merged and qualified. A theory-level identity
in J-Space. A clean AIEN-P0 lineage. Any evaluator code. Any world generator. The independent human or
agent evaluator.

What must wait. EST-3 and everything behind it (calibrated uncertainty claims in D3 for AIEN runs).
TURING selection (PZ-ACTIVE, D8 for AIEN). M20 (tensor-valued rungs on AIEN hardware paths).
Sealing of any commitment (BLOCKED_OPERATOR).

What can begin now. The C11 evaluator and independent scorer; world generators for PZ-A, PZ-B and
PZ-C; reference solvers; null and adversarial world libraries; commitments in public form; the
leakage canary and label-permutation tooling; a Q0 spec using a paired-real encoding.

Capabilities that earn their place across several rungs. Declared transformation with observation map
(Noether, gauge, basis, coordinates, field redefinition). Invariant claims with honest labels (PZ-B,
PZ-C, Q0, Q3, S0). Theory-link edges (Q1, X-0, T-0, SC-0). Discrepancy models (Q0, Q2, S2, T-0).
Distribution-valued laws (S1, Q0, Q2, Q4). Testable validity regions (SC-0, S2, T-0). Value types for
complex and tensor (Q0, Q1, Q2, F rungs, Q6).

Recommended first build: the C2S-0 Representational Adequacy Lab (Addendum A.10). It needs only the evaluator and reference solvers, and it gates every Dirac challenge. Recommended next specs after it: SC-0 and X-0, because Drake's emphasis is laws that change with scale and the
same physics in different forms. Alternative: swap Q2 for SC-0 in the first six if the quantum
prerequisites (complex types) are judged too far away. The recommendation is to keep the six as written
and write SC-0 and X-0 next.

C2S addition. What exists: nothing implemented for C2S. What is missing: the adequacy evaluator, the
three-world lab, a matrix-capable candidate-side value type, and a Cortex-level class-failure claim
(reuse unproven). What must wait: every Dirac challenge until PHYSICS_ZERO_C2S_FOUNDATION_PASS;
novel-prediction gates until a clean lineage and a sealed commitment exist. What can begin now: the
C2S-0 lab (worlds A, B, C and null variants) with reference solvers only.
