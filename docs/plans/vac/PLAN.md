# VAC: Verifiable Autonomous Computing, implementation plan (2026-10-08)

**NOT A MASTER PLAN.** This is a finite workstream document under [PLAN_AUTHORITY.md](../../../PLAN_AUTHORITY.md) ("Component-local plans"). It does not change architecture, the milestone registry or the cross-project sequence. [doctrine/ARCHITECTURE.md](../../../doctrine/ARCHITECTURE.md), [doctrine/ROADMAP.md](../../../doctrine/ROADMAP.md) and [CURRENT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md](../../../CURRENT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md) win on any conflict. Implementation and evidence beat this text: where this text and a repository's merged code differ, the code is right and the difference is a defect here.

**Status:** record of one day of work, 2026-10-08, written after milestones M1, M2 and M3a merged. M3b (interplane#83) is open as of the check in section F, so every statement about M3b is a statement about an unmerged branch.

## How to read the citations

- `SC` = aien-dev/aien-sovereign-core, `IP` = aien-dev/interplane, `ARCH` = this repository. `path:line` was read by the author of this document at the named commit (SC 47f1014a1, IP 860065742 for main, IP e958a9c9 for the M3b branch).
- `PR #n + commit` is a merged pull request and its merge commit. `receipt <path>` is a file committed in a repository or a local log under `~/handoffs/vac/` on the Spark.
- `[scout]` means the fact was read by a read-only scout report on 2026-10-08 (`~/handoffs/vac/scout-A.md` to `scout-D.md`, local to the Spark, not committed) at the pins below, and was not re-read for this document. `UNVERIFIED` means nobody read it.
- Labels used in verdicts are exact strings the verifier prints: `PASS complete`, `PASS_LABELLED_INCOMPLETE missing=...`, `FAIL <code>`.

Pins (GitHub default branches, 2026-10-08 15:47Z unless noted): SC 9b5e6e82 then 47f1014a1 after #346; omega 2ae8677c; omega.lock in SC 6c6180cf; IP 01bc340d then 860065742 after #82; aienos 8928c427; ARCH e01b19c1 at start of the mission (this document branches from 60c92db); aien-protocols 66610096; aegis-runtime f4e87095; spark-rsi e5aab9ad; physics 9f96f255; benchmarks 8d4dfde8; waldo 0fd421ab; odysseus (branch dev) 2992bf6d. Source of the start pins: `~/handoffs/2026-10-08-vac-mission.md`.

## Rules that bind every claim here

- A scripted model turn is never `PASS complete`. All runs recorded below are scripted and end `PASS_LABELLED_INCOMPLETE` (receipt `IP adapters/aien/evidence/live-gate-2026-10-08/receipt.json`).
- Exported records are unsigned. The verifier cannot tell an export from a hand-written file (IP provenance/BINDING.md:73; receipts' `limits`).
- The desk MAC on the ordinary `ComposeAuthorize` path is default off. Drake decided on 2026-10-08 to preserve that default; it is not changed by this workstream (SC crates/aien-runtime/src/spine.rs:1792 `authorize_requires_desk: false`; issue sc#328 holds the question).
- The test run in the fix-the-test slice is harness evidence, not a daemon effect. The daemon only writes the file (IP provenance/BINDING.md "The test run is harness evidence", branch e958a9c9).

## A. Current reality

Chain studied: INTERPLANE CapabilityRequest -> crossveil Pipeline -> `adapters/aien` (ApprovalBinding signed with the desk key) -> daemon socket `ComposeApprovedProposal` -> `approved.rs` (replay claim, MAC check) -> compose commit -> `approved_grant` -> `ComposeEffectIntent` -> client write -> `ComposeEffectAck` -> Cortex journal -> export -> IP `provenance` offline verify.

Stale text found, listed here and not rewritten: the module doc of `approved.rs:10` says the hook "never writes the workspace and never mints an" authority, while the path writes an `approved_grant` (read at 47f1014a1; the sentence continues past line 10). `tools/aien-test/src/lib.rs:1` says "Slices A to C" while slices D and G exist. Both are candidate issues, not changed here.

## B. Target product contract

**Product 1.** A small fixture repository holds a program and one deliberately failing test. An agent is given the task id and the repository pin and fixes the program. The fix is a `write_file` effect through the existing authority path; nothing else writes into the workspace. Qualification runs use a scripted model turn; a real model is a later row.

**Flow, each step with its existing owner.**
1. Task record: task id, fixture commit, test command (`vac-task`, `vac-source-pin`; implemented on the M3b branch, IP provenance/BINDING.md).
2. Agent reads files through INTERPLANE `read_file` / `list_dir` (IP adapters/aien/src/lib.rs).
3. Agent emits `write_file` as a `CapabilityRequest`; crossveil returns `requires_approval`; a host-side approver approves; the binding `aien.approval.v2` is signed with the desk key (SC approved_auth.rs:50; IP adapters/aien/src/compose_ledger.rs).
4. Adapter sends `ComposeApprovedProposal`; the daemon claims replay keys once, runs compose, writes `approved_grant`.
5. Intent, client write, `ComposeEffectAck` with `DONE`, `NOT_DONE` or `UNRESOLVED` decided by daemon read-back (SC effects.rs:1592-1663).
6. Test run, after a `DONE` ack, by the harness, recorded as `vac-test-run/1` bound to the ack by the post-write blob digest (`disk_sha256`). It has no grant, no intent and no ack and is never given authority.
7. Export: ledger slice plus task, source pin, test run, native report, trace, load log and model file hashes, named in `COMPANION.json` by path, sha256 and size.
8. Offline `provenance verify <dir>` prints one line.

**What the verifier checks (implemented).** Retained files match their sha256 and size; INTERPLANE envelopes validate; request id, trace id and approval key recompute from the ledger slice; written path and bytes equal the approved bytes; claim, grant, intent and ack are present and consistent (IP provenance/src/lib.rs:898 compares the producer-reported `success`). With the M3b branch it also checks: source pin against the grant's `prior_sha256`; the test-run record against the ack's `disk_sha256`; exit code 0 after and non-zero before; stdout and stderr digests against retained files; the native claim against the retained `compose_recall` report. Codes as implemented, M3b branch: `test_run_missing`, `unsupported_test_run`, `source_pin_mismatch`, `test_run_mismatch`, `native_claim_contradicted` (IP provenance/src/testrun.rs; BINDING.md checks 1 to 5).

**What it does not prove.**
- Authenticity of exported records: they are unsigned and daemon-written; a same-user process able to append to the compose ledger could forge them (IP provenance/BINDING.md:73).
- Which human approved: the MAC proves a holder of the desk key.
- Approval authenticity on the ordinary `ComposeAuthorize` path while the desk MAC default is off. The product path uses `ComposeApprovedProposal`, where the MAC is mandatory.
- That the test run happened as recorded. The harness writes the record. Re-running the pinned fixture is the independent check.
- That a model produced the proposal: scripted turns keep `link:model_turn` missing.
- That nothing else touched the workspace between the ack and the second test run (BINDING.md "Does not prove").
- That a native build was used when the field is absent: a daemon older than #346 reports nothing, and the verifier labels `link:native` missing.

**Failure boundaries (target behaviour; test coverage as in section E).**
- Ack `DONE`: verdict can reach the labelled-incomplete pass; `PASS complete` additionally needs a non-scripted model turn.
- Ack `NOT_DONE` or `UNRESOLVED`: the target-blob check fails against the ack, so no test run is trusted. UNVERIFIED as a dedicated live test; SC recovery tests cover the daemon side (M1 matrix, `~/handoffs/vac/M1-qualification.md` section 3, rows "interrupted operation").
- Replay of an approved submission: refused (SC approved_attacks_test c09 to c11, M1 matrix "duplicate submission").
- Stub build: every compose call is `Unavailable`; ComposeRecall returns an error rather than `compose_native=false` (finding in `~/handoffs/vac/M3a-report.md`).
- Test fails after a `DONE` write: UNVERIFIED. The verifier rejects `exit_code != 0` as `test_run_mismatch` for this slice, because the slice claims a fix; task failure and provenance are not yet separate verdicts. The earlier draft proposed separating them; that is not implemented.

## C. Gap matrix G1 to G6

| Gap | Required behaviour | Status 2026-10-08 | Evidence | What remains |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Adapter and daemon agree at SC main; live-daemon rows runnable as a gate | CLOSED by #82 to the extent proven: pin 4d4dfd4 -> 9b5e6e82, gate runs 5 rows against a native daemon, verifies the bundle, runs 5 tamper checks | PR IP#82 860065742; receipt `IP adapters/aien/evidence/live-gate-2026-10-08/receipt.json`; M1 finding 1 (14 rows green at the old pin) | The gate is a host script, not a CI job; no CI job builds a native daemon. 9 of 14 live rows are not covered by the committed receipt (they passed in M1 only). |
| G2 | Test run recorded as evaluation evidence bound to the ack | CLOSED on the M3b branch to the extent proven by one live run and 24 synthetic tests; NOT on IP main until #83 merges | PR IP#83 (open); receipt `IP adapters/aien/evidence/fix-the-test-2026-10-08/receipt.json` (branch) | Merge of #83; a real model turn; sandboxing of the test command is not implemented. |
| G3 | One bundle carries task id, source pin, native/stub | Native/stub: CLOSED by #346 (daemon side) and #83 (verifier side). Task id and source pin: on the #83 branch. Model identity: carried as before (`model_generation` / `scripted_turn`) | PR SC#346 47f1014a1; PR IP#83 | Weights-to-text provenance stays at the existing `model_generation/2` limit. |
| G4 | Approval authenticity on every authority-minting path | OPEN, Drake decision: desk MAC default stays off | SC spine.rs:1792; issue sc#328 | Nothing in this workstream changes it. A bundle for a run that used the ordinary path cannot be treated as MAC-backed. |
| G5 | Versioned records where the bundle depends on them | PARTIAL: new records carry a schema string (`vac-test-run/1`, `aien.native` section, `COMPANION` binding strings). Ledger and journal records stay unversioned by design | IP provenance/BINDING.md (branch); SC effects.rs:1628 [scout] | Receipt-id unification stays ADR 0033 / ARCH-0029 Decision 6 scope. |
| G6 | Reproducible scripted demo from a clean checkout | OPEN; assigned to M4a. The two gate scripts exist and are reproducible on the Spark but need a prepared native build | IP adapters/aien/scripts/test-live-daemon.sh, test-fix-the-test.sh (branch) | A single `demo.sh run | verify | selftest` from a clean clone. |

## D. Execution graph

Order by dependency. Each milestone ends in a pull request and a row in section E.

| Milestone | Definition of done | State 2026-10-08 |
|---|---|---|
| M1 baseline | Matrix of the authorized path with commands, exit codes, binary hash, native/stub status; no repo edits | DONE. `~/handoffs/vac/M1-qualification.md`: linked gate 393 PASS; 47 in-process + 14 live adapter tests PASS; 84 provenance tests PASS; 11 of 12 matrix rows covered, stub-build row NOT RUN. |
| M2 live verified run (closes G1) | Verifier judges a real authorized run; negative checks refuse | DONE and merged: IP#82 860065742 (gate GATE PASS 18:16Z to 18:51Z). |
| M3a native report (part of G3) | Daemon reports native/stub | DONE and merged: SC#346 47f1014a1 (linked gate 401 PASS, CI 3 of 3 SUCCESS at 19bf64e per `~/handoffs/vac/M3a-report.md`; CI states re-read for this document: SUCCESS on all three checks). |
| M3b fix-the-test slice (G2, G3, G5) | Fixture with failing test, scripted fix through the real daemon, test-run record, source pin, verifier links, tamper tests | IMPLEMENTED, NOT MERGED: IP#83 open, head e958a9c9, all 10 CI checks SUCCESS at head e958a9c9 (`gh pr view 83 --json statusCheckRollup`). Independent review pending. |
| M4a clean-checkout demo (G6) | One script from a clean clone prints the verdict; selftest mutates each retained file and the verifier refuses each | OPEN. |
| M4b this document in ARCH | Plan, qualification record and change log in `docs/plans/vac/` | This pull request. |
| M5 bounded RSI hookup | spark-rsi proposes a Tier1 change through the approved path; ratifier still makes a branch only; Tier2 gap reported, not changed | NOT STARTED. Stops at a design note if it needs a new protocol (action-protocol is unused by SC). |

Stop conditions: a Drake decision (desk MAC default, sc#327 model default, releases, keys, reboots) stops the milestone and reports. No milestone changes GPU or chip code. `quietlock check` precedes every long run.

### Relation to ADR 0033

[ADR 0033](../../adr/0033-aien-verification-pipeline.md) (PROPOSED, 2026-10-04) defines the Check IR, exactness classes, signed `VerificationBundleV1` and the `receipt_id_scheme` field. This plan does not restate or change any of it. For this slice the verifier is `interplane/provenance`, and it checks the INTERPLANE-to-AIEN effect chain, not the ADR 0033 gate graph. The bundle formats are different objects: `COMPANION.json` is unsigned and VAC-specific, `VerificationBundleV1` is signed. Unifying the receipt id schemes and adopting the signed envelope stay ADR 0033 and ARCH-0029 scope. No new ADR is created here: nothing in this plan changes subsystem responsibility. If the `vac-test-run/1` and `COMPANION` test-run section become a normative cross-repo wire contract, that is a separate ADR (the next free number is 0036; 0035 is the highest present).

## E. Qualification record

All runs: host Spark (`spark-b87b`, Linux 7.0.0-1019-nvidia aarch64, 20 cores), CPU only, GPU engine is the CPU stub (`Backend: NativeTransformerBackend/CPU-reference`), model unsloth Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct snapshot 5a8abab, model turn scripted. Native compose library linked from omega.lock `6c6180cf` in every row except the SC stub-build row, which was not run. Source of the environment: `~/handoffs/vac/M1-qualification.md` section 1; `~/handoffs/vac/M3b-report.md`.

Known limits of this record, none softened:
- Runs 5, 6, 8 and 9 are scripted-model runs. None is `PASS complete`.
- `sovereign_core_rev` in the run 5 receipt is caller-asserted; the daemon does not print its revision (M2 report, Limits). Run 8 records the daemon commit the same way.
- Run 5 covers 5 of 14 live rows; the other 9 passed in run 3 only. The full `test-live-daemon.sh` (about 45 minutes) was not re-run after the M3b wiring change (M3b report, "Limits").
- A forged native claim on a real stub daemon was only tested on synthetic bundles, because a stub daemon returns an error to ComposeRecall (M3b report; M3a finding).
- The stub-build row of the M1 matrix was NOT RUN. The REPL tool path and crossveil's own tests were not run in M1.
- Debug builds were used; each live row spent about 6.5 minutes in daemon start in run 3.
- The linked gate was run with `AIEN_OMEGA_DIR` unset, so the GPU engine is the CPU stub. Nothing here is a GPU result.

### Superseded by code (record codes and bindings as implemented)

The 2026-10-08 draft (`~/handoffs/vac/PLAN-DRAFT.md`, local, not committed) proposed names that changed when the code was written. The implemented form wins:
- Proposed record `test_run/1`, binding `aien-test-run/1`: implemented as `vac-test-run` version 1 in `COMPANION.test_run.binding = "vac-test-run/1"`, with companion records `vac-task` and `vac-source-pin` (IP provenance/BINDING.md, branch).
- Proposed refusal `not_native`: not implemented. Implemented as `native_claim_contradicted` for a claim the retained report does not support, and as the label `link:native` missing (verdict stays incomplete, not a FAIL) when the field is absent or `claimed: false`.
- Proposed schema bump of `COMPANION` from 0 to 1: not done. The `test_run` and `aien.native` members are optional additions; bundles without a `test_run` section are unchanged (BINDING.md, "Native claim").
- Proposed harness-side probe for native/stub (`aien --version` style): replaced by the daemon-side report in `ComposeRecallReport` (SC#346). Stub daemons return an error on recall, so they never emit `compose_native=false` (M3a report).
- Proposed bundle-level verdict `NOT_FIXED` separating task failure from provenance: not implemented. A non-zero exit after the write is `test_run_mismatch` today (section B).
- Proposed CI job that builds a native daemon in IP CI (G1): not implemented. The gate is a host script (`adapters/aien/scripts/test-live-daemon.sh`).
- The draft said the adapter pin was "31 commits behind" and that protocol drift was UNVERIFIED. Measured result: no drift observed in 14 live rows (M1 finding 1); crate diff 4d4dfd4 to 9b5e6e8 for `aien-capability` and `aien-mcp` is empty (M2 report, Commands).
