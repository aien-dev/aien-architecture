# Current Code → R0–R16 Migration Map

**NOT A MASTER PLAN.** This is a finite workstream plan for ADR 0016, the resident reaction architecture. `CURRENT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` still owns cross-project sequencing, and `doctrine/ROADMAP.md` still owns milestone status. The R-gates below are ADR 0016 gates, not M-milestones.

**Written:** 2026-09-27. The code facts come from reading `origin/main` of each repository on that date:

| Repository | Commit |
|---|---|
| omega | `1feb832` |
| physics | `a477aee` |
| aienos | `aien-dev/aienos` main, last commit 2026-09-25 |
| aien-sovereign-core | main, 2026-09-27 |
| aegis-runtime | `2bbce76` |
| aien-protocols | main, 2026-09-23 |

The rules are those in ADR 0016 §60: code plus reproducible evidence decides what is true today, ADR 0016 decides the destination, and nothing is deleted before rollback is proven.

---

## 1. What exists today, in one paragraph

Nothing in any repository is reactive. The following were not found anywhere:

- a dependency index;
- a wake-on-change subscription;
- semantic invalidation;
- a loop that outlives one request or one boot.

Every runtime path today is shaped as orchestration:

- `omega/tools/omegatool.c` sequences gates and demos by hand.
- M19 `omega_world_*` is a synchronous register → submit → ring → drain service.
- `aien-sovereign-core` `aien-runtime/src/spine.rs:112` is `for 0..max_steps { step() }`, driven once per request.
- `aegis-runtime` `agent.rs:130` is an LLM tool-turn loop. `heartbeat.rs:94` polls an SQLite task table.
- AIENOS boot runs a fixed demo sequence and halts: `aienos-boot/src/handoff.rs:1621`.

Nothing in code drives AIEN → Omega → AEGIS. The word "omega" does not appear in aienos, sovereign-core, or aegis-runtime.

The pieces worth keeping are primitives, not runtimes:

| Primitive | Location |
|---|---|
| Generation-checked kernel capabilities | aienos `caps.rs` |
| Atomic OLD-or-NEW store commits | aienos Store v1 |
| Content-addressed evidence DAG | sovereign-core `aien-proof` |
| Pointer-free coherent shared-world ABI | physics/omega branch `m20-shared-world`, not merged |
| Canonical semantic identity | Omega M4 |
| Realization selection | Omega M12/M14 |
| Native GPU submission | M16–M19 |

## 2. Gate status (evidence-backed only)

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| R0 `R0_REACTION_ARCHITECTURE_LOCKED` | PASS on merge of ADR 0016 | `docs/adr/0016-resident-reaction-architecture.md` |
| R1 `R1_SHARED_WORLD_PASS` | NOT CLAIMED | Host reference pool exists (`omega/src/runtime/rx_world.*`). The canonical pool must unify with `OMEGA_SHARED_WORLD_V1`. |
| R2 `R2_CROSS_ENGINE_ABI_PASS` | NOT CLAIMED | The ABI exists on unmerged branch `m20-shared-world` (58/58 host checks). There is no silicon run. |
| R3 `R3_REACTION_CORE_PASS` | **PASS (host reference, CPU only)** | omega `tests/runtime/rx_heartbeat_test.c` (`make test-r3`). Receipt `omega/evidence/R3/ef3e5565b9deda5226b58caf00c3e05f467cf03f6ae91984c10898d98e28c321.json`: candidate `9dd9594`, clean tree, 15/15 tests, 8,948 checks, 0 failures. |
| R4 `R4_CAUSAL_TRACE_PASS` | **PASS (host reference, CPU only)** | Same receipt. Every reaction crumb in every test is audited for trigger, inputs, authority, outputs, and ancestry: 1,727 audited, 7,016 digests re-verified. |
| R5 `R5_RESOURCE_ARBITRATION` | PASS | host reference, not silicon (#36-#38) |
| R6 `R6_REACTION_STABILITY` | PASS | host reference, not silicon (#36-#38) |
| R7 `R7_NATIVE_AUTHORITY` | PASS | host, against the native C authority (#41, #43) |
| R8 `R8_CONSTITUTIONAL_AEGIS` | PASS | host (#48, `fe4924a`) |
| R9 `R9_GENERATION_BARRIER` | PASS | host (#42, `00be7ae`) |
| R10 `R10_CONTINUOUS_OMEGA` | PASS | DGX Spark CPU (#46, `0a787ee`) |
| R11 `R11_CONTINUOUS_COGNITION` | PASS | DGX Spark CPU (#47, `628daf5`) |
| R12 resident GPU seat | PASS | GB10 silicon (#44, `05b0692`; hardening #45, `4331bf3`) |
| R13 faculties as one causal system | PASS (causal verification PASS, AIEN goal MET) | GB10 silicon (#49, `fcb5793`) |
| R14 living recovery | PASS | GB10 silicon (#50, `f70ae10`) |
| R15 quantitative performance | PASS | DGX Spark (#67, `bba3bd3`, 16/16 gates) |
| R16 orchestrator retirement | IN PROGRESS | DGX Spark (#68 draft, spec pre-registered, active inventory) |

The R3/R4 claims are scoped to the host reference runtime. They say nothing about GPU execution (R12) or about the native AIENOS capability root (R7).

## 3. Module map

Legend:

- **Keep**: used as is.
- **Adapt**: kept, with a changed role or an extension.
- **Replace**: superseded as the mechanism for this purpose. It stays in place as the reference oracle until R16.
- **Oracle**: legacy behavior the new path is compared against.

Parallelization groups (§4) are marked **G0–G6**.

## 4. Order and parallelization

```text
G0  R0 ADR 0016 ─────────────────────────────────────────────── (merge)
         │
G1  host runtime (omega src/runtime; new files only)
    R3 ✔ ─ R4 ✔ ─ R5 modulation ─ R6 storm/loop ─ R7-host ─ R8 resident AEGIS
         │                                            │
G2  shared-world substrate (physics shared_world + omega worker)
    [after M19R Gate 2 and an idle GB10]              │
    R1 unify pool ↔ OMEGA_SHARED_WORLD_V1 ─ R2 ABI ───┼──────────── R12 silicon
         │                                            │
G3  native root (aienos)                              │
    caps.rs epoch + lease ─ read-only authority view ─ R7-native ─ R8-native
         │
G4  durability [ADR 0015 merged 2026-09-27; starts after R5–R8]
    choose causal hash ─ R9 generation barrier via Store v1
         │
G5  faculties
    R10 Omega continuous realization   (after R5, R6)
    R11 AIEN continuous cognition      (after R8, shadow mode first)
         │
G6  integration (serial)
    R13 golden path ─ R14 failure path ─ R15 performance proof ─ R16 retire orchestration
```

Why this order:

- R5 and R6 come before any real faculty. A reaction system without admission and storm control must not grow (§22: inspection before scale).
- R7 comes before R8 because the root must exist before resident authority can refer to it.
- R9 uses the ADR 0015 commit protocol (merged 2026-09-27) and follows R5–R8.
- R12 needs silicon. Its claim is never made from host runs (§60 item 8).

Disjoint ownership, so these groups can run at the same time:

- G1 touches only `omega/src/runtime/**` and `omega/tests/runtime/**`.
- G2 touches `physics/shared_world/**`, `physics/coherent/**`, and new omega worker files.
- G3 touches aienos.
- G4 touches aienos store and aien-proof.

These groups share no files with M19R Lanes A–E, except that G2 must wait for M19R Gate 2 before adapting `omega_accelerator_world.*`.

## 5. Open items found while mapping

1. **Naming collision.** The unmerged "M20 Stage 1 `OMEGA_SHARED_WORLD`" work conflicts with ROADMAP M20 = `OMEGA_TENSOR`. Recommend relabelling it R1/R2 under ADR 0016 when those branches are merged.
2. **Causal-identity hash.** Omega uses SHA-256 (semantic IDs, crumbs). `aien-proof` uses BLAKE3. Pick one before crumbs become durable (R9). Recommend SHA-256 for continuity with `SEMANTIC_ID` and the Physics/M3 receipt chain.
3. **Mint authentication.** Both the host root and the kernel root enforce attenuation. Neither yet authenticates which principal may request a fresh (non-delegated) mint. This is R7/R8 scope.
4. **Python.** It remains in physics (`run_milestone2_gates.py`, `seam*_*.py`), sovereign-core (11 files) and spark-rsi. None of it is touched by this track, and R-gate tooling stays C/bash/Rust.
5. **`spark-aegis` symlink.** sovereign-core depends on an absolute-path symlink to an untracked directory.
