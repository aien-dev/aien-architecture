# Brownian calibration program: public explainer (Wave 1)

Status date: 2026-09-30. This is the public account of how the hidden-law calibration program (code name Brownian) is run, what has been done, and where it departed from its plan. It deliberately leaves out every evaluator-only detail: hidden settings, thresholds, the list of model families, cell names, sample sizes, seed labels and preregistered signs. Those stay in a private evaluator repository until the final sealed run (BRN-10) is finished; after that they are published in full.

## What the program is for

AIEN will later be asked to find a hidden law in data it has never seen. Before any such result can mean anything, the scoring machinery has to be shown to work on cases where the right answer is known. Wave 1 is that check. It certifies the scorer; it is not a discovery claim, and no sentence in any report may say that AIEN discovered a physical law.

The score is description length: how many bits a model needs to describe both itself and the held-out data. A model that captures real structure saves bits compared with a declared baseline; the saving, with a bootstrap interval, is the score.

## How cheating by the operator is prevented

- **Commit, then reveal.** Before any sealed data exists, the SHA-256 fingerprint of the private profile (the full set of rules and thresholds) and of the frozen evaluator code is published in omega at `docs/brownian/PROFILE_COMMITMENT.txt`. That file holds only the newest version, so each version's fingerprint is also pinned in the append-only file `docs/brownian/PROFILE_COMMITMENT_HISTORY.txt` in omega (omega #104). After BRN-10 the files are published and anyone can check they match.
- **One shot per profile.** Each sealed run can be attempted once under a given profile. The tool writes an attempt record before it generates any sealed data, and it refuses a second attempt. A failure cannot be quietly retried.
- **No moving the goalposts.** No threshold or analysis choice may change after sealed scores exist. Any fix after a failure needs a new profile version, a new fingerprint and fresh sealed data, and the failed run stays in the record.
- **Sample sizes come from simulation**, fixed before any sealed data, never chosen after seeing results.
- **Access.** Humans may read the private material by request: email drake@aienos.com; after verification you get read-only access. Please do not paste it into any AI tool before the sealed run is finished.

## The ladder and where each rung stands

A claim is limited by the highest rung that passed. A later success never erases an earlier failure, and every failed or blocked rung is listed.

| rung | what it checks | status |
|---|---|---|
| CAL-0 | the evaluator is calibrated | PASS |
| EXP-001 | the compression bridge (ideal lengths match two real coders) | first attempt FAIL; successor EXP-001R PASS |
| EXP-002A | the scorer certifies the simplest known family | first profile BLOCKED; successor PASS |
| EXP-002B | the scorer certifies the second stage | PASS (without the Occam curve) |
| Occam curve | how the score trades model size against fit | PASS (v1.3, its own row) |
| EXP-002C | the scorer certifies emerging structure, plus an intervention phase | PASS under v1.2; repeated and PASS on fresh sealed worlds under v1.3 |
| EXP-002D | hostile and adversarial cases give their expected verdicts | INCOMPLETE (no wrong verdicts; the coder-check safety case now runs and passes under v1.3; one rule is not evaluable in Wave 1) |
| interventional replication | the intervention effect repeats on fresh worlds | PASS (v1.3, fresh sealed worlds) |
| EXP-003 | active experiment choice (Wave 2) | BLOCKED |
| H3 replay | stored scores replay byte for byte | PASS (v1.2 and v1.3 scores) |
| H3 statistical | the preregistered hypotheses hold on sealed data | PASS |
| H4 | GPU rows | INCOMPLETE |
| H5 | six different compiler builds give the same scores | PASS (v1.2 and v1.3 scores) |
| sensitivity | verdicts are stable under preset variants | BLOCKED |
| independent replication | independent implementation (in-house), not external lab | BLOCKED |

Update 2026-10-09 (development only, outside the ladder): EXP-002D stays INCOMPLETE; its last development mismatch was diagnosed as a statistical edge, not a code fault (omega#348). A separate development demonstration, BRW-ACT, has a hand-coded reference candidate choose its next noisy measurement and compares it with random and fixed schedules under equal measurement budgets. See omega `docs/turing/BRW_ACT_RESULTS.md`. It is self-run, unsealed and has no independent evaluator, so it does not count toward EXP-003, which stays BLOCKED.

## Departures from the plan, in full

1. **EXP-001 failed, and was replaced.** The first compression-bridge run failed one audit: a single sealed test item was identical, in its visible part, to one development item. The cause was a small space of possible items in one category, not a leak of answers. The failure stands and is published (omega #95). A successor, EXP-001R, ran with the same candidates and criteria, a tightened and documented overlap rule and new seeds, and passed (omega #99).
2. **The profile binds Turing profile v1.1, not v1.0.** The Brownian profile names the Turing scoring profile it builds on. Because EXP-001 was replaced by EXP-001R, the frozen run binds the v1.1 Turing profile (the one EXP-001R passed under). The Brownian profile text itself was unchanged.
3. **A descriptive figure was wrong.** The frozen profile understated the worst-case false-alarm rate of one safety check, because an early calculation missed the largest cell. The check itself (its pass rule) was not changed; the corrected figure is used in every report.
4. **The fingerprint was published after the freeze, not before the development data.** The fingerprint's second line has to name the final code, which only exists after the freeze. It was published before any sealed data was generated. Certification fits no candidate to development data, so nothing was exposed.
5. **EXP-002A was BLOCKED under the first profile.** Every scientific check passed, but the plan required one comparison model to be fitted on a cell where that fit is mathematically undefined. The fit could not be made, the tool refused it as designed, and the plan's own rule turned that refusal into a block. The contradiction was in the plan, not in the data or the code. Fixing it after sealed scores existed would have been moving the goalposts, so it went to a new profile (v1.1) with one added rule: an exactly-determined comparison fit is not scored.
6. **The first attempt under v1.1 failed on a missing folder.** The operator script had not created one output folder. The tool records the attempt before it checks the folder, so the attempt was used up with no data produced. We did not delete that record. The attempt went to profile v1.2, which is v1.1 plus a note recording the failure, with no rule change, and the script was fixed. EXP-002A (as EXP-002AR), EXP-002B and EXP-002C then all passed under v1.2.
7. **One safety check was "not evaluated".** One stop condition compares a candidate's reported parameter intervals. Certification candidates report predictions, not parameter intervals, so the check has nothing to measure and is reported as not evaluated, with that reason. It must be defined before EXP-003, where candidates do report intervals.
8. **The Occam curve needed a further profile.** Producing it needs extra cells, which meant a fourth profile in Wave 1, and the profile limit was three. The limit was raised from three to four, for one final Wave 1 profile (v1.3), on Drake's behalf by the integrator under his standing instruction. Drake may override this. A fifth profile needs Drake by name.
9. **Rungs blocked by rules, not by results.** The sensitivity variants need new preset choices, so a new profile; interventional replication was also blocked here until v1.3 supplied fresh worlds (departure 12). EXP-003 needs a separate Wave 2 contract. The independent re-implementation would have to be briefed from the private profile, which no outside AI may see before the sealed run. The GPU rows are not defined in Wave 1. None of these is counted as passed.
10. **Outside review is deferred.** The plan asks for an outside AI to check the mathematics of each new profile. The confidentiality rule forbids showing the private material to any outside AI before the sealed run, so that review happens after BRN-10.
11. **Two build findings.** The two highest-optimisation builds in the six-build check refused to compile under the strict warnings setting, because a piece of verdict description text was cut short. That was a wording defect, not a scoring one; those two builds were first made with that single warning allowed, and all six builds agreed exactly. Both findings are now handled in v1.3: the adapter that measures real coded lengths and runs one safety check is part of the v1.3 frozen code, and the high-optimisation builds now compile under the strict warnings setting with no exception.
12. **Profile v1.3.** v1.3 sealed the Occam-curve cells and re-ran the emerging-structure experiment on fresh worlds. Its fingerprint (omega #103) was published before any v1.3 sealed data existed. Before the freeze, two practice rehearsals on throwaway worlds (not the sealed ones) exposed three things, all fixed before the freeze. (a) On the Occam cells only one comparison is meaningful, so each Occam cell scores exactly that one comparison; a cell with a missing score makes the result incomplete, never a pass. (b) The independent coder check cannot confirm predictions far out in the tail, so a fixed range limit was set before the freeze: a prediction outside the range is only allowed on the side that lost the comparison, and is listed by name; anything else stops the run. (c) A text limit that cut the list of such cases short was fixed. Outcome: the Occam curve, the repeated emerging-structure experiment and the intervention repeat all passed on the v1.3 sealed worlds; the coder check confirmed every scored comparison apart from a few far-tail cases on the losing side, which the rule allows and lists by name; the hostile safety check that could not run before now runs and passes; replay and the six builds agree exactly. Results under v1.2 are never re-analysed under v1.3.
13. **The commitment file was overwritten per version.** `PROFILE_COMMITMENT.txt` was rewritten in place for v1.1, v1.2 and v1.3, under a line prefix that names the file format, not the version. The link from each version to its fingerprint therefore existed only in git history. A repository watch caught this the same day. It was fixed by the append-only history file (omega #104). No fingerprint changed and no sealed run was affected.

## What may be claimed

Only the outcome sentences in the profile may be used. A certification pass says the scorer behaves as specified on known cases. It says nothing about AIEN discovering anything.
