## 1. Core Doctrine & The First Principle

### 1.1 The Decoupling Principle
> **First Law of Sovereign Computing:**
> *Meaning must never be permanently coupled to representation, nor semantics to physical execution.*

In conventional computing systems, computation is frozen at the moment of compilation. High-level mathematical relationships and algorithmic intents are lowered through intermediate representations (e.g., LLVM IR, JVM bytecode, SPIR-V) into rigid sequences of binary instructions targeting a hypothetical or specific microarchitecture. During this lowering, vital semantic context is destroyed:
1. **Mathematical Invariants are Discarded:** Associativity, distributivity, error bounds, and domain symmetries are collapsed into fixed sequences of register moves and floating-point operations.
2. **Hardware Assumptions are Hardcoded:** Vector widths, cache line alignments, thread block hierarchies, and memory layouts become immutable artifacts in the emitted binary.
3. **Adaptability is Extinguished:** When runtime conditions change—such as a shift in input distribution, an unexpected thermal throttle, or migration to a new execution substrate—the binary cannot restructure its fundamental execution strategy without external recompilation.

**Omega** rejects this static paradigm. Omega defines computation not as a sequence of machine instructions, but as a dual-layer construct:
* An immutable, pure **Semantic Graph** that asserts *what must be true*;
* A mutable, evolving **Realization Graph** that records *how that truth is physically manifested on concrete hardware*.

### 1.2 Omega Defined: Language and Substrate
Omega is both:
1. **A Formal Semantic Language:** A declarative, mathematically rigorous calculus capable of expressing computation as graphs of values, operations, constraints, and invariants without reference to registers, threads, warps, or bytes.
2. **A Living Realization Substrate:** An autonomous runtime environment that continuously matches semantic intent to available physical machinery, synthesizing direct machine code, measuring empirical execution evidence, and evolving optimal realizations in real time.

## 2. The Three Core Graphs

Omega models all computation, execution, and hardware topology through three interdependent graphs:

+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### 2.1 The Semantic Graph ($\mathcal{G}_S$)
The Semantic Graph $\mathcal{G}_S = (\mathcal{V}_S, \mathcal{E}_S)$ defines pure computational truth.
* **Nodes ($\mathcal{V}_S$):**
  * `ValueNode`: Algebraic values, tensor sets, or categorical states.
  * `OperatorNode`: Pure mathematical functions (e.g., Linear Transform, Convolution, Non-linear Projection, Contraction, Outer Product).
  * `ConstraintNode`: Invariant assertions that must hold across execution (e.g., shape conservation, range boundaries, numerical stability thresholds).
* **Edges ($\mathcal{E}_S$):** Directed dependencies defining data-flow, dimensional broadcasting, and logical preconditions.

#### Semantic Invariants:
1. **Physical Agnosticism:** $\mathcal{G}_S$ contains zero references to threads, warps, registers, cache lines, pages, or instruction set architectures (ISAs).
2. **Numeric Domains and Error Tolerances:** Every floating-point or fixed-point operator specifies an explicit error envelope $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}^+$. An operation is mathematically valid if and only if the realization produces output $\hat{y}$ satisfying $\|\hat{y} - y_{exact}\| \le \epsilon$.
3. **Aliasing and Memory Independence:** Values are referentially transparent. Concepts of "in-place mutation" or "pointer aliasing" do not exist in $\mathcal{G}_S$; they are realization choices relegated entirely to $\mathcal{G}_R$.

### 2.2 The Realization Graph ($\mathcal{G}_R$)
The Realization Graph $\mathcal{G}_R = (\mathcal{V}_R, \mathcal{E}_R)$ maps nodes in $\mathcal{G}_S$ to concrete physical executions on $\mathcal{G}_M$.
* **Nodes ($\mathcal{V}_R$):**
  * `RealizationNode`: A concrete executable strategy for a sub-graph of $\mathcal{G}_S$.
    * **Target Machine:** Reference to a valid node in $\mathcal{G}_M$.
    * **Executable Artifact:** Direct machine bytes, microcode descriptors, or hardware command buffers.
    * **Input Regime:** The dimensional and numerical range $[N_{min}, N_{max}]$ where this realization is valid and optimal.
    * **Resource Footprint:** Register allocation count, scratchpad memory bytes, vector register pressure.
    * **Evidence Tuple:** $(\text{Latency } \tau, \text{Energy } \mathcal{J}, \text{Throughput } \Theta, \text{Error Observed } \hat{\epsilon})$.
    * **Proof Status:** Formal verification token (`UNPROVEN`, `EMPIRICALLY_VERIFIED`, `FORMALLY_PROVEN`).
* **Edges ($\mathcal{E}_R$):** Execution sequencing, register/buffer handoffs, synchronization barriers, and memory coherence transitions.

### 2.3 The Machine Graph ($\mathcal{G}_M$)
The Machine Graph $\mathcal{G}_M = (\mathcal{V}_M, \mathcal{E}_M)$ is the formal physical topology of the hosting platform.
* **Execution Primitives:** Scalar ALUs, SIMD/NEON pipelines, Matrix-Multiply Accumulate (MMA) tensor cores, photonic interconnects, and DMA engines.
* **State Spaces & Hierarchies:** Register files (scalar, vector, predicate), L1/L2/L3 caches, unified system SRAM, High Bandwidth Memory (HBM3e), host-device shared memory pools (NVLink-C2C).
* **Interconnect Characteristics:** Bandwidth ceilings ($GB/s$), latency penalties ($ns$), cache-coherency domains, memory ordering models (Weak, Total Store Order, Sequential Consistency).
* **Failure & Thermal Domains:** Power consumption limits, throttling thresholds, fault isolation zones.

## 3. Future-Proof Physics: Beyond the Bit

Omega is grounded not in the silicon transistor or the binary bit, but in fundamental thermodynamics and physical state manipulation. 

### 3.1 The Eight Universal Physical Capabilities
Any physical machine $\mathcal{M}$, whether digital CMOS, neuromorphic, optical, or quantum, is modeled by Omega through eight universal capabilities:

| Universal Capability | Physical Definition | Invariant Contract |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`State`** | Retention of distinguishable physical configurations across a duration $\Delta t$. | State entropy must not exceed dissipation threshold $S_{max}$. |
| **`Transform`** | Controlled transition between states governed by an operator $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$. | Operator must conserve required invariant properties within $\epsilon$. |
| **`Observe`** | Non-destructive or controlled readout of physical state into an internal register. | Read disturbance must remain within bounded limits. |
| **`Store`** | Spatially localized, persistent entropy reduction against thermodynamic decay. | Data retention guaranteed for time $t_{retention}$ without refresh. |
| **`Transfer`** | Relocation of state through spacetime channels between physical coordinates. | Channel capacity governed by Shannon/Nyquist physical bounds. |
| **`Synchronize`** | Enforcing causal ordering or phase locking across spatially separated nodes. | Causal horizon bounded by speed of light $c$ and interconnect delay. |
| **`Measure`** | Empirical quantification of cost: energy $\Delta E$, time $\Delta t$, entropy $\Delta S$. | Measurements must be recorded with calibrated uncertainty $\sigma$. |
| **`Reset`** | Erasure of state to a canonical ground configuration. | Satisfies Landauer's principle ($E_{dissipated} \ge k_B T \ln 2$ per bit). |

By abstracting execution to these eight universal primitives, Omega code written today remains semantically valid on optical computing fabrics, quantum annealing engines, or molecular storage substrates.

## 4. Multi-Modal Semantic Representations

A semantic construct in Omega exists across multiple simultaneous representations, each optimized for a specific consumer without altering semantic identity.

```

### 4.1 The Five Representations
1. **Human Representation:**
   * Textual, human-readable DSL syntax based on s-expressions and typed mathematical equations.
   * Focuses on programmer intent, formal constraints, and domain proofs.
2. **Canonical Representation:**
   * Deterministic, normalized, content-addressed AST.
   * Free of variable naming artifacts (De Bruijn indexed), sorted associative terms, and explicit canonical formatting. Used for cryptographically signing semantic intent.
3. **Compact Representation:**
   * Dense, entropy-coded binary serialization.
   * Optimized for minimal disk footprints, immutable storage snapshots, and network transport across sovereign nodes.
4. **Shared (Zero-Copy) Representation:**
   * Flat, 64-byte aligned, struct-of-arrays memory structures.
   * Directly readable by both CPU cores and GPU SMs over coherent memory fabrics (e.g., NVLink-C2C) without pointer chasing or deserialization overhead.
5. **Device-Resident Representation:**
   * Direct execution descriptors mapped inside GPU VRAM / HBM.
   * Pre-baked into command queues, DMA descriptor chains, and hardware register configuration blocks.

## 5. Semantic Identity & Content-Addressed Ontologies

### 5.1 The Principle of Semantic Invariance
> **Invariant:**
> $$\forall A, B: \quad \text{Meaning}(A) \equiv \text{Meaning}(B) \implies \text{SEMANTIC\_ID}(A) == \text{SEMANTIC\_ID}(B)$$
> *A difference in physical realization, memory layout, register choice, or instruction sequence NEVER alters the underlying Semantic ID.*

### 5.2 The Unified Identity Taxonomy
Every entity within the Sovereign Machine possesses a cryptographically secure, 256-bit content-addressed identity computed using BLAKE3:

| Identity Type | Mathematical Input to Hash Function | Scope & Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`SEMANTIC_ID`** | $\text{BLAKE3}(\text{Canonical AST}(\mathcal{G}_S) \parallel \text{Constraints} \parallel \epsilon)$ | Pure meaning. Target-agnostic and permanent. |
| **`REALIZATION_ID`** | $\text{BLAKE3}(\text{SEMANTIC\_ID} \parallel \text{MACHINE\_ID} \parallel \text{MachineBytes} \parallel \text{ABI})$ | Specific physical execution implementation. |
| **`MACHINE_ID`** | $\text{BLAKE3}(\text{Vendor} \parallel \text{Arch} \parallel \text{Topology} \parallel \text{Units} \parallel \text{Stepping})$ | Deterministic identity of the physical machine. |
| **`EFFECT_ID`** | $\text{BLAKE3}(\text{REALIZATION\_ID} \parallel \text{InputDigests} \parallel \text{CausalParent} \parallel \text{Epoch})$ | Specific execution of a state-mutating action. |
| **`PROOF_ID`** | $\text{BLAKE3}(\text{SEMANTIC\_ID} \parallel \text{REALIZATION\_ID} \parallel \text{ProofProofTree})$ | Machine-checked verification certificate. |
| **`EVIDENCE_ID`** | $\text{BLAKE3}(\text{EFFECT\_ID} \parallel \text{TelemetryCounters} \parallel \text{ObservedError})$ | Empirical runtime observation receipt. |
| **`MODEL_ID`** | $\text{BLAKE3}(\text{ArchitectureAST} \parallel \text{WeightMerkleRoot} \parallel \text{QuantConfig})$ | Inference weights and parameter sets. |
| **`MEMORY_ID`** | $\text{BLAKE3}(\text{BaseAddress} \parallel \text{Length} \parallel \text{CoherenceDomain} \parallel \text{Epoch})$ | Coherent physical buffer handle. |

## 6. Minimal Semantic Core & Bootstrap Hierarchy

### 6.1 The Eleven Core Primitives
The entire Omega language is built upon exactly eleven irreducible primitives:

1. **`Value`**: An atomic element inhabiting a mathematical domain (e.g., scalar, tensor, categorical).
2. **`Type`**: The definition of domain bounds, structural dimensionality, and valid operations.
3. **`Operation`**: A pure mathematical transformation mapping $f: X \to Y$.
4. **`Relation`**: A logical predicate defining an invariant or equivalence between entities ($R(X, Y) \to \{0, 1\}$).
5. **`Constraint`**: An inviolable condition (e.g., maximum numerical deviation $\epsilon$, shape broadcasting rules).
6. **`Memory`**: An abstract bounded space capable of retaining state across time.
7. **`Machine`**: An instance of a physical substrate with defined physical capabilities.
8. **`Effect`**: A declared, controlled interaction that crosses the boundary of the pure machine (I/O, time, mutation).
9. **`Realization`**: The binding contract connecting an `Operation` to a `Machine` via concrete executable instructions.
10. **`Evidence`**: Quantified physical observation of execution (energy, time, error, cache hit rate).
11. **`Proof`**: A verifiable deductive token establishing that a `Realization` strictly satisfies its `Constraints`.

### 6.2 The Sovereign Self-Hosting Loop
Omega does not rely on third-party host environments or legacy operating systems. It bootstraps through a strict four-stage cycle:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| STEP 0: Atlas Seed                                                      |

| verifies its own correctness proofs, and hot-swaps the running binary.  |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

## 7. First Physical Backend: AArch64 Direct Native Machine Byte Generation

Omega rejects intermediate compilation frameworks (such as LLVM, Cranelift, or GCC) for its core engine. These toolchains introduce gigabytes of untrusted legacy code, unverified lowering passes, non-deterministic optimizations, and slow compilation cycles. 

Omega generates raw AArch64 machine instructions directly into executable memory pages.

### 7.1 Instruction Encoding Mechanics
Every AArch64 instruction is a fixed 32-bit (4-byte) little-endian integer. The Omega backend directly packs these bitfields:

```
 31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
|sf|   opc   | 1  1  0  1  0  0  0  0 |      Rm     |   imm6   |      Rn     |      Rd     |
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
```

#### Core Instruction Generators:
* **`ADD (Register, 64-bit)`**:
  $$\text{Encoding} = \mathtt{0x8B000000} \mid (R_m \ll 16) \mid (R_n \ll 5) \mid R_d$$
* **`LDR (Register, 64-bit)`**:
  $$\text{Encoding} = \mathtt{0xF8606800} \mid (R_m \ll 16) \mid (R_n \ll 5) \mid R_t$$
* **`FMUL (Single-Precision Vector, 4S)`**:
  $$\text{Encoding} = \mathtt{0x4E20DC00} \mid (V_m \ll 16) \mid (V_n \ll 5) \mid V_d$$
* **`FMLA (Single-Precision Vector by Element, 4S)`**:
  $$\text{Encoding} = \mathtt{0x4F801000} \mid (V_m \ll 16) \mid (V_n \ll 5) \mid V_d$$
* **`RET`**:
  $$\text{Encoding} = \mathtt{0xD65F03C0}$$

### 7.2 Zero-Indirection Memory Execution
The realization engine allocates dual-mapped or sequenced memory pages via the sovereign page allocator:
1. Allocate physical frame pool.
2. Map with `PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE`.
3. Emit raw 32-bit instruction words sequentially into the buffer.
4. Execute `ISB` (Instruction Synchronization Barrier) and `DSB ISH` (Data Synchronization Barrier, Inner Shareable).
5. Flush data cache to point of unification via `DC CVAU`, invalidate instruction cache via `IC IVAU`.
6. Transition page protection to `PROT_READ | PROT_EXEC`.
7. Direct branch (`BLR`) into the generated function pointer.

## 8. Living Realization: Case Study — Matrix-Vector Product ($y = A x + b$)

To demonstrate how the Living Realization cycle operates, consider the ubiquitous deep-learning primitive:
$$y = A \cdot x + b \quad \text{where } A \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times N}, \; x \in \mathbb{R}^N, \; b, y \in \mathbb{R}^M$$

```

### 8.1 The Living Cycle
1. **Realize:** The synthesis engine checks $\mathcal{G}_M$ capabilities and generates multiple candidate realizations ($R_0 \dots R_5$).
2. **Verify:** Test runs verify outputs against pure numerical bounds:
   $$\max_i |y_{observed}[i] - y_{reference}[i]| \le \epsilon$$
3. **Measure:** On-chip Performance Monitoring Units (PMU) measure cycle counts, instructions per cycle (IPC), L1/L2 cache misses, and energy consumption via hardware telemetry.
4. **Record:** Performance receipts are bound to $(\text{REALIZATION\_ID}, \text{EVIDENCE\_ID})$ and stored in the `EVIDENCE_STORE`.
5. **Select:** At runtime, the dispatcher executes a branch-free selection table based on active dimensions $(M, N)$ and system load.

### 8.2 The Six Realization Variants

#### Variant $R_0$: Scalar AArch64 (Baseline)
* **Target:** General AArch64 cores without vector extension or tiny $N$ ($N \le 4$).
* **Strategy:** Outer loop over $M$, inner loop over $N$ using scalar `FADD` and `FMUL`.
* **Resource Cost:** 4 general-purpose registers, 3 scalar floating-point registers.

#### Variant $R_1$: NEON x2 Vectorization
* **Target:** Standard NEON pipeline, 64-bit vector registers (`D0`-`D31`).
* **Strategy:** Processes pairs of `FP32` values with `FMLA.2S`. Reduces loop overhead by $2\times$.

#### Variant $R_2$: NEON x4 Quad-Word Vectorization
* **Target:** Full 128-bit NEON execution units (`Q0`-`Q31`).
* **Strategy:** Evaluates 4 floats per instruction using `LDR Q` and `FMLA.4S`.

LDR     Q2, [A_ROW_PTR, OFFSET]   // Load 4 elements of matrix row A[i, :]
FMLA    V0.4S, V1.4S, V2.4S       // V0 = V0 + (Q1 * Q2)
ADD     OFFSET, OFFSET, #16
```

#### Variant $R_3$: NEON x8 Dual-Accumulator Vectorization
* **Target:** Out-of-order execution engines with multiple FMA pipelines (Cortex-X / Neoverse-V).
* **Strategy:** Unrolls the loop $8\times$ using two independent vector accumulators (`V0.4S` and `V3.4S`) to break the floating-point latency dependency chain.
* **Latency Benefit:** Hides 4-cycle FMA pipeline latency, achieving theoretical peak throughput of 2 instructions per cycle.

#### Variant $R_4$: Small-$N$ Register-Resident Specialized Kernel
* **Target:** Fixed small-dimension models (e.g., $N = 16, M = 16$).
* **Strategy:** Complete loop unrolling. Entire vector $x$ loaded permanently into registers `V8`-`V11`. Matrix values streamed continuously. Branch count = 0.

#### Variant $R_5$: Aligned 64-Byte Streaming Kernel with Cache-Bypass
* **Target:** Large matrices ($N > 4096$) that exceed L2 cache capacity.
* **Strategy:** Uses software data prefetching (`PRFM PLDL1KEEP`) 256 bytes ahead of the load pointer. Utilizes non-temporal streaming stores (`STNP`) to prevent cache pollution of the output destination.

## 9. Unified Shared Memory Architecture: CPU/GPU Zero-Copy Coordination

In legacy systems, communication between CPU and accelerator (GPU/NPU) relies on high-latency RPC mechanisms, user/kernel context switches, and costly serialization formats (Protobuf, FlatBuffers, JSON).

Omega completely abolishes serialized RPC. Coordination occurs across a **Unified Coherent Physical Memory Address Space** (e.g., NVLink-C2C on NVIDIA Grace-Blackwell platforms). CPU and GPU exchange only **64-bit IDs, generation counters, and ring buffer offsets**.

### 9.1 Shared Memory Structures

#### 1. `SEMANTIC_STORE`
* **Layout:** Append-only, content-addressed memory arena.
* **Content:** Immutable canonical semantic nodes and graph structures.
* **Access Model:** Read-only to workers; read-write to the Omega semantic planner. Once written, nodes are immutable and cached forever.

#### 2. `INTENT_RING`
* **Layout:** Cacheline-aligned circular ring buffer with atomic head/tail pointers.
* **Payload:** 64-byte descriptors containing:
  * `target_semantic_id`: 32 bytes
  * `realization_id`: 32 bytes (or `NULL` if dynamic selection requested)
  * `input_tensor_handles`: Array of memory IDs
  * `generation`: 64-bit epoch sequence counter
* **Protocol:** The CPU publishes execution intent by writing a descriptor and atomically incrementing the tail pointer with Release semantics (`stlr`). The GPU accelerator consumes intents with Acquire semantics (`ldar`).

#### 3. `EFFECT_RING`
* **Layout:** Sequenced transactional queue for requested physical effects.
* **Enforcement:** Enforces the AEGIS security boundary. Accelerators cannot execute I/O, disk writes, or network egress directly; they emit an `EffectDescriptor` into the `EFFECT_RING` for verified dispatch by the host.

#### 4. `RESULT_RING`
* **Layout:** Completion queue matching the `INTENT_RING`.
* **Payload:** Status code, output tensor memory handle, and hardware execution cycle timestamps.

#### 5. `PROOF_RING`
* **Layout:** Parallel queue for mathematical verification jobs. Formal proof engines (running on spare cores or accelerators) dequeue execution traces and verify that output values strictly conform to $\mathcal{G}_S$ error bounds.

#### 6. `EVIDENCE_STORE`
* **Layout:** Columnar time-series ring buffer.
* **Payload:** Raw hardware counter samples: nanoseconds elapsed, watts dissipated, instructions executed, cache misses, and calculated arithmetic intensity.

#### 7. `CAPABILITY_TABLE`
* **Layout:** Atomic, globally visible system manifest.
* **Payload:** Bitfield enumeration of active hardware resources, online vector units, available VRAM pages, thermal margins, and active ISA revisions.

#### 8. `FAULT_MAILBOX`
* **Layout:** Priority interrupt mailbox.
* **Protocol:** Used for immediate execution abortion upon invariant violation, floating-point exception (NaN/Inf generation), or hardware memory parity errors.

## 10. The Sovereign Invariant & System Evolution

### 10.1 The Autonomous Self-Optimization Loop
The ultimate objective of Omega is the realization of a completely autonomous, self-optimizing, sovereign computational runtime.

When an Omega-powered machine operates:
1. It does not run static programs; it resolves **Semantic Invariants**.
2. If an operation runs slowly, Omega generates a new realization variant in the background.
3. It benchmarks the candidate on the live hardware using canary inputs.
4. If the new realization proves faster while preserving mathematical error bounds ($\hat{\epsilon} \le \epsilon$), Omega updates the realization pointer in the dispatch table.
5. The transition is instantaneous, atomic, and completely transparent to the user.

```
       Meaning is Eternal. Realization is Ephemeral. The Machine is Sovereign.
```

```c
// All structures are strictly 64-byte aligned to prevent false sharing
// across NVLink-C2C cache lines.

typedef struct __attribute__((aligned(64))) {
    uint8_t   semantic_id[32];     // BLAKE3 hash of Canonical Semantic AST
    uint8_t   realization_id[32];  // BLAKE3 hash of Machine Code + Target
} omega_intent_entry_t;

## 11. Program Synthesis, Procedure Library & Concept Formation

### 11.1 The Internal Trust Decomposition of OMEGA
OMEGA contains both trusted verification authorities and untrusted generative/search machinery:

```text
OMEGA
├── OMEGA SEMANTIC CORE          TRUSTED CONTRACT
├── OMEGA VERIFIER               TRUSTED CHECKER (V0-V2 mandatory; V3-V5 progressive)
├── OMEGA SYNTHESIS              UNTRUSTED SEARCH (Enumeration, e-graphs, constraints)
├── OMEGA ABSTRACTION MINER      UNTRUSTED SEARCH (Subgraph mining, candidate formation)
├── OMEGA REALIZATION SEARCH     UNTRUSTED SEARCH (Instruction scheduling, tiling search)
└── OMEGA LIBRARY
      ├── CANDIDATE               UNTRUSTED (Unverified speculation)
      └── VERIFIED/PROMOTED       TRUSTED BY EVIDENCE (Formally verified & measured)
```

### 11.2 Deterministic Synthesis Engine (V0)
Synthesis begins deterministically without neural guidance:
- Typed enumeration + constraint propagation + cost bounds + dynamic programming + e-graph equivalence pruning + bidirectional search.
- Solves closed-domain synthesis tasks before any neural guide is trained.

### 11.3 Two Distinct Libraries
- **Semantic Library:** Platform-independent abstractions (`MAP`, `FOLD`, `NORMALIZE`, `ATTENTION`). Survives across hardware substrate transitions.
- **Realization Library:** Target-specific implementation blocks (`NEON_TILE_4`, `BLACKWELL_TILE_X`, `CACHE_BLOCKED_GEMM`). Ephemeral and substrate-bound.

### 11.4 Abstraction Discovery and Expandable Invariant
When repeated subgraphs are mined during sleep phases:
- A candidate abstraction must prove net positive value via Minimum Description Length (MDL) compression and search reduction on held-out tasks.
- **The Expandable Invariant:** Every promoted abstraction $\mathcal{A}$ must retain its exact formal expansion graph $\mathcal{G}_{\text{exp}}$ ($\mathcal{A} \leftrightarrow \mathcal{G}_{\text{exp}}$) to permit auditing, proof checking, recompilation, and migration.
