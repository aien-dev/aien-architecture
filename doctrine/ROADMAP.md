## 1. Authority of This Document

This file is the **single authoritative source** for Sovereign Machine milestone numbering, milestone code identifiers, and milestone status.

- Every other doctrine page references this file instead of restating the milestone table or milestone status.
- Milestone status is changed **only** here. A status change must cite the qualifying evidence (issue, PR, or receipt).
- `scripts/check_doctrine.sh` enforces this: it fails if another doctrine page duplicates the roadmap table, carries its own milestone status tags, or cites a milestone code identifier under a milestone number different from the one below.

Status vocabulary:

| Status | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `COMPLETE` | Milestone gate passed and ratified. |
| `COMPLETE / QEMU QUALIFIED` | Gate passed under QEMU qualification; native hardware qualification remains separately gated. |
| `REOPENED / IN PROGRESS` | Previously reported complete; reopened for requalification. Not complete. |
| `PLANNED` | Not started. |

## 3. Milestone Notes & Evidence

### M1 — `ATLAS_BOOT`
- Repository: https://github.com/aien-dev/atlas
- Canonical Artifact: `atlas.bin` (1,480 bytes, SHA-256: `f7802501b410a0c19eff7b8fca8865c9ba9c96bfa4f8065ca8f508b67748b9a5`)
- Dual-Seam Verification:
  - Seam 1 (Static Audit): 100% word-reconciled (301 insns, 69 rodata words, 0 discrepancy), static target proof (`ldr x19, =0x40200000; br x19`), disjoint stack/descriptor proof (SP <= `0x401FC000` vs Descriptor @ `0x401FE000` with 8 KiB guard gap, empty intersection).
  - Seam 2 (Execution Harness): Bare-metal QEMU virt; 268/268 mutations refused into fail-closed quiescence (exhaustive 256 single-byte offset sweep + 12 adversarial scenarios).
  - Cryptographic Scheme: Bare-metal NIST FIPS 180-4 SHA-256 (KAT verified 100%).
- Native Hardware Status: `ATLAS_BOOT_NATIVE_PASS` remains pending and decoupled from QEMU qualification.
- Specification: [`docs/milestone-1-spec.md`](../docs/milestone-1-spec.md).

### M2 — `PHYSICS_BOOT`
- Requalified 2026-09-26 under aien-dev/aien-architecture#6, aien-dev/physics#1, and aien-dev/physics#3 (descriptor ingress anti-expansion, frame authority bounds, and exception confinement hardening). Ratified via qualification receipt (`qualification_receipt.json`).
- Exception level is contract-driven: Physics checks `CurrentEL` against the machine contract and installs `VBAR_EL1` or `VBAR_EL2` accordingly, with no implicit EL2 -> EL1 transition. The current QEMU contract, `CONTRACT-QEMU-VIRT-AARCH64-M2`, specifies EL1 entry.
- `PHYSICS_BOOT_QEMU_PASS` does not imply `PHYSICS_BOOT_NATIVE_PASS`.
- Specification: [`docs/milestone-2-spec.md`](../docs/milestone-2-spec.md).

### M3 — `PHYSICS_EFFECTS`
- Qualified 2026-09-26 under `aien-dev/physics#9` (merged as commit `766f8fd6b898f4df793ffa809f031040ba0912fa`), ratified via qualification receipt `m3/m3_qualification_receipt.json` in commit `a7dc4ef7e0ea9fa733d06114eb31a26d70cb3e53`.

- Grounded in observed DGX Spark physical topology (`spark-b87b`): NVIDIA GB10 (`10de:2e12` @ `000f:01:00.0`, IOMMU group 20), ARM SMMUv3 (`arm-smmu-v3.1.auto` @ `0x13000000`, Stream ID `0x0100`), BAR0 aperture `0x24000000-0x27ffffff` (64 MiB), within 128 GiB unified coherent LPDDR5x DRAM `[0x80000000, 0x2080000000)`.
- Canonical Boundary Principle:
  - M15 establishes who may touch the accelerator (authority model & topology grounding).
  - M16 discovers how the accelerator is actually commanded (empirical submission path discovery).
  - Native Blackwell submission mechanics intentionally deferred to M16; 0 guessed MMIO writes performed.
- Subsystem ownership boundaries recorded: Linux kernel/driver holds active hardware programming; Physics holds sovereign authority model; bare-metal takeover deferred.

### M16 - `BLACKWELL_NATIVE_PATH_KNOWN`

- Requalified 2026-09-26 under `aien-dev/physics`:
  - Implementation Commit: `physics@a2c0d7fbc03f7ce91fcb6389312a0ee8630322cd`
  - Requalification Receipt Commit: `physics@92038f7`
  - Canonical Main Commit: `physics@b64753d95bacb1114ba48decde48239f0c542e12` (PR #11)
  - Requalification Receipt: `physics/evidence/m16-blackwell-native-path-requalification-receipt.json`
  - Audit Dossier: `physics/evidence/m16-requalification/M16_REQUALIFICATION_AUDIT.md`
- Historical Original Qualification:
  - Original Commit: `physics@f72e2974793a288c5dd910180f4685deffa31bb7`
  - Original Receipt: `physics/evidence/m16-blackwell-native-path-receipt.json`
  - Status: **SUPERSEDED / FAILED INDEPENDENT RUNTIME AUDIT**
  - Historical Record: Retained in git history as an immutable audit record. The original harness linked and loaded `libcuda.so.1`, called CUDA initialization APIs (`cuInit`, `cuStreamCreate`), and reused session-specific queue addresses.
- Grounded on live DGX Spark (`spark-b87b`) hardware without libcuda:
  - Hardware: NVIDIA GB10 (Grace Blackwell, sm_121 / 0xa04), GPU ID `0xf0100`, bus `0000000f:01:00.0`.
  - Zero Foreign Userspace Runtime: `ldd`, `nm -u`, and `/proc/$PID/maps` verified zero `libcuda`, `libcudart`, or `libnvidia` dependencies. Linked strictly against standard C library (`libc.so.6`).
  - Native Resource Allocation: Raw ioctls on `/dev/nvidiactl`, `/dev/nvidia0`, and `/dev/nvidia-uvm` dynamically allocate client, device, subdevice, memory, and channel resources.
  - Usermode doorbell aperture: class `0xC661` (`HOPPER_USERMODE_A`) at BAR0 offset `0xbb0000` (`0x24bb0000`), register offset `+0x90` (`NVC361_NOTIFY_CHANNEL_PENDING`).
  - GPFIFO format: 1,024 8-byte entries per channel; bit 41 (`LEVEL_SUBROUTINE`) pushbuffer dispatch.
  - Pushbuffer command stream: `NVC06F_DMA_SEC_OP_INC_METHOD` packets (`SET_OBJECT` method `0x000` to `BLACKWELL_COMPUTE_B` `0xcec0`, `SEM_ADDR_LO` method `0x5c`).
  - Completion attribution: pushbuffer method `0x5c` (`SEM_ADDR_LO`) writing coherent memory marker with `RELEASE` (`0x1`) flanked by `MEM_OP_D` flushes, polled directly by CPU across NVLink-C2C.
  - Causality proven: 5/5 consecutive trials demonstrate that withholding the doorbell store strictly prevents execution (marker remains 0x0), while issuing the store immediately triggers completion (marker transitions to target value).
  - Concurrency verified: Independent contexts execute concurrently without memory collision or crosstalk.
- Raw evidence bundle sealed under `physics/evidence/m16-requalification/` (with `SHA256SUMS`).
- Specification: [`docs/milestone-16-spec.md`](../docs/milestone-16-spec.md).

### M17: `OMEGA_BLACKWELL_VECTOR`

- M16 Authority Substrate: `aien-dev/physics@b64753d` (PR #11).
- Specification: [`docs/milestone-17-spec.md`](../docs/milestone-17-spec.md).
- Silicon Target: NVIDIA DGX Spark (`spark-b87b`), Grace Blackwell GB10 (sm_121, 128 GiB unified LPDDR5x RAM).
- Semantic Contract: Unsigned 32-bit vector addition ($C[i] = (A[i] + B[i]) \pmod{2^{32}}$) with exact bit-for-bit mathematical parity against OMEGA semantic oracle across boundary lengths $N \in \{1, 15, 63, 64, 65, 127, 128, 256, 1024\}$.
- Four-Component Realization Identity: $\text{SHA-256}(\text{spec\_id} \parallel \text{machine\_id} \parallel \text{code\_digest} \parallel \text{sm\_arch})$ uniquely locking semantic operation, machine graph, machine code artifact, and GPU SM microarchitecture.
- Qualification Gates: 18 / 18 Milestone 17 qualification gates passed.
- Cumulative Regression Accounting: 121 / 121 regression gates across prior milestones (M4 through M15) passed. Total 139 gates evaluated and passed (zero failures, zero regressions).
- Zero Foreign Userspace Runtime: Zero dynamic linkage to `libcuda.so` or `libcudart.so` (`ldd`), zero undefined dynamic CUDA symbols (`nm -u`), zero runtime mappings in `/proc/self/maps`.
- Clean-Clone Reproduction: Verified from scratch on DGX Spark silicon in isolated clone `/tmp/omega-clean-m17`.
- Cortex Receipt: Space `atlas-memory`, receipt ID `dea831e3-33c8-480c-bff3-2f170bf9b3b0`.

### M18: `OMEGA_BLACKWELL_MATMUL`
- Status: **IN PROGRESS**.
- Formally opened 2026-09-26.
- Specification: [`docs/milestone-18-spec.md`](../docs/milestone-18-spec.md).
- Mandate: Verified native Blackwell tensor matrix multiplication with tensor core acceleration.
- Architecture: Synthesizes sm_121 tensor core instructions using QMD launch descriptors and native M16 pushbuffer submission.
- Sovereignty Boundary: Crosses from verified static instruction fixtures to dynamic native code generation: semantic MatMul contract lowers through OMEGA instruction selection, operand and field encoding, tensor-core instruction sequencing, dynamic QMD launch descriptors, and native M16 submission on physical GB10 silicon under exact and numerically bounded verification.


### M22 — `OMEGA_OPTIMIZER`
Omega-native semantics for SGD, Adam, and AdamW, with verified CPU reference realizations and optional accelerator-fused realizations.

### M40 — `AIEN_SUCCESSION`
Closed-loop self-improvement: AIEN-N designs AIEN-N+1 under Physics canary control.

## 4. Historical Provenance: Superseded Roadmap Generations

> **HISTORICAL — NOT NORMATIVE.** Retained only to explain older references. Do not cite these numbers.

- **28-milestone workstream roadmap (M0-M27, workstreams A-F):** ended at M27 `SOVEREIGN_MACHINE_CLOSURE`; its identifiers (e.g. `ATLAS_BAREMETAL_BOOT`, `PHYSICS_CORE_MEMBRANE`, `SENTINEL_GATE_1..3`) are retired.
- **31-milestone program-learning roadmap (M0-M30):** placed `AIEN_HUMAN_INTERFACE` at M27, `AIEN_RESIDENT` at M28, `OMEGA_CONTINUAL_LIBRARY_LEARNING` at M29, and `AIEN_SUCCESSION` at M30. Superseded by the 41-milestone roadmap above when Physics Zero (DOCTRINE-006) was ratified.
- **Alpha lineage:** `atlas.bin` was designated Alpha (`alpha.bin`) during early bootstrap drafting; the Alpha evidence bundle names (`alpha.manifest`, `alpha.sha256`, `alpha.decode`, `alpha.memory-map`, `alpha.control-flow`, `alpha.audit`) are retired in favour of `atlas.*`.
